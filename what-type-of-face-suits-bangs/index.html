Bangs can be a great way to change up your hairstyle and add some interest to your look, but not all bangs are created equal. In this article, we'll explore what type of face suits bangs and give you some tips for finding the perfect style for you.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#how-to">How to Determine Your Face Shape</a></li><li><a href="#bangs-for-each-face-shape">Bangs for Each Face Shape</a></li><li><a href="#face-shape-not-matching">What to Do If Your Face Shape Doesn't Match Any of These Categories</a></li><li><a href="#hair-type">Consider Your Hair Type</a></li><li><a href="#face-shape-changing">Can Your Face Shape Change?</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Getting Bangs</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs about Getting Bangs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Bangs</a></li></ol><h2 id="how-to">How to Determine Your Face Shape</h2><p>The first step in figuring out what type of face suits bangs is to determine your face shape. There are six main face shapes:</p><ul><li>Round</li><li>Oval</li><li>Square</li><li>Heart</li><li>Diamond</li><li>Long</li></ul><p>To determine your face shape, look in the mirror and use a tape measure to measure the following:</p><ul><li>Forehead: Measure across the widest part of your forehead, just above your eyebrows.</li><li>Cheekbones: Measure across your cheekbones, starting at the pointiest part below the outer corner of your eye.</li><li>Jawline: Measure from the tip of your chin to the point below your ear where your jaw angles upward. Then multiply that number by two to get the full measurement.</li><li>Face length: Measure from the center of your hairline to the tip of your chin.</li></ul><p>Once you have these measurements, compare them to the following guidelines:</p><ul><li>Round: Forehead and jawline are about the same width, with a rounded chin.</li><li>Oval: Face length is longer than the width of the cheekbones, and forehead is wider than the jawline.</li><li>Square: Forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are about the same width, with a squared-off chin.</li><li>Heart: Forehead is wider than the cheekbones, and the chin tapers to a point.</li><li>Diamond: Face is widest at the cheekbones, with a narrow forehead and jawline.</li><li>Long: Face is longer than it is wide, with a high forehead and long jawline.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you're having trouble determining your face shape, there are also online quizzes and apps that can help you figure it out.</p><h2 id="bangs-for-each-face-shape">Bangs for Each Face Shape</h2><p>Now that you know your face shape, let's talk about what type of face suits bangs. Here are some guidelines:</p><h3>Round Face</h3><p>If you have a round face, you'll want to choose bangs that help elongate your face and create the illusion of length. Consider:</p><ul><li>Side-swept bangs that are longer on one side than the other</li><li>Asymmetrical bangs that are shorter on one side and longer on the other</li><li>Long, wispy bangs that can be pushed to the side</li></ul><h3>Oval Face</h3><p>If you have an oval face, you're in luck! Almost any type of bangs will suit your face shape. Consider:</p><ul><li>Straight, blunt bangs</li><li>Side-swept bangs</li><li>Wispy bangs</li><li>Baby bangs (short, straight across bangs)</li></ul><h3>Square Face</h3><p>If you have a square face, you'll want to choose bangs that soften your features and create a more rounded look. Consider:</p><ul><li>Side-swept bangs that are longer on one side than the other</li><li>Curved bangs that follow the natural curve of your eyebrows</li><li>Long, wispy bangs</li></ul><h3>Heart Face</h3><p>If you have a heart-shaped face, you'll want to choose bangs that balance out your forehead and chin. Consider:</p><ul><li>Side-swept bangs that are longer on one side than the other</li><li>Curved bangs that follow the natural curve of your eyebrows</li><li>Long, wispy bangs</li><li>Baby bangs (short, straight across bangs)</li></ul><h3>Diamond Face</h3><p>If you have a diamond-shaped face, you'll want to choose bangs that help balance out your forehead and chin. Consider:</p><ul><li>Side-swept bangs that are longer on one side than the other</li><li>Curved bangs that follow the natural curve of your eyebrows</li><li>Long, wispy bangs</li><li>Baby bangs (short, straight across bangs)</li></ul><h3>Long Face</h3><p>If you have a long face, you'll want to choose bangs that help shorten your face and create the illusion of width. Consider:</p><ul><li>Side-swept bangs that are longer on one side than the other</li><li>Curved bangs that follow the natural curve of your eyebrows</li><li>Long, wispy bangs</li><li>Baby bangs (short, straight across bangs)</li></ul><h2 id="face-shape-not-matching">What to Do If Your Face Shape Doesn't Match Any of These Categories</h2><p>If you don't feel like your face shape fits neatly into any of these categories, don't worry! You can still get bangs. You may just want to experiment with different styles to see what looks best on you. Consider asking your hairstylist for advice.</p><h2 id="hair-type">Consider Your Hair Type</h2><p>Another factor to consider when choosing bangs is your hair type. If you have thin hair, you may want to avoid heavy, blunt bangs that can make your hair look even thinner. If you have curly hair, you may want to choose bangs that are longer and can be styled to blend in with the rest of your curls.</p><h2 id="face-shape-changing">Can Your Face Shape Change?</h2><p>It's worth noting that your face shape can change over time due to factors like weight loss or gain, aging, and even changes in hairstyle. So, even if you think you know your face shape, it's always a good idea to reassess every once in a while.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Getting Bangs</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind if you're considering getting bangs:</p><ul><li>Bring pictures: Bring pictures of the type of bangs you want to your hairstylist to make sure you're both on the same page.</li><li>Consider your lifestyle: If you're always on the go and don't have a lot of time to style your hair, you may want to choose a low-maintenance bang style.</li><li>Be prepared for upkeep: Bangs require regular trimming to maintain their shape, so be prepared to visit the salon every 4-6 weeks.</li><li>Start small: If you're not sure if you want full-on bangs, try starting with a side-swept style or baby bangs.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs about Getting Bangs</h2><h3>Will bangs make me look younger?</h3><p>Bangs can help soften your features and create a more youthful look, but it ultimately depends on the style you choose and how well it suits your face shape and hair type.</p><h3>Can I wear bangs with glasses?</h3><p>Yes! Just make sure to choose a style that doesn't interfere with your glasses and consider getting your bangs trimmed more frequently to avoid them poking you in the eyes.</p><h3>Can I still wear my hair up with bangs?</h3><p>Absolutely! You may just need to experiment with different updo styles to find what works best with your bangs.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Bangs</h2><p>Here are some tips for taking care of your bangs:</p><ul><li>Wash and blow-dry your bangs separately from the rest of your hair to avoid tangling.</li><li>Use dry shampoo or baby powder to combat oiliness between washes.</li><li>Trim your bangs yourself in between salon visits using hair scissors.</ </article>

Here are the basic steps involved in cutting shaggy hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Before cutting your hair, make sure it's clean and dry. This will help you see the natural texture of your hair, making it easier to cut. Use a shampoo and conditioner that works well for your hair type.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into sections, starting from the top of the head and working your way down.

This will help your makeup last longer and prevent it from smudging or creasing. Use your fingers or a brush to apply the primer all over your face.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Foundation</h3><p>Choose a foundation that matches your skin tone and apply it all over your face using a brush or sponge. Make sure to blend it well, especially around your jawline and hairline.</p><h3>Step 3: Conceal Blemishes and Dark Circles</h3><p>Use a concealer that matches your skin tone to cover any blemishes, dark circles, or redness. Apply it to the affected areas using a brush or your fingers and blend it well.</p><h3>Step 4: Contour Your Cheekbones and Jawline</h3><p>Use a contouring palette to enhance your cheekbones and create a more defined jawline. Apply the contour powder to the hollows of your cheeks and blend it well. Then, use a highlighter to accentuate your cheekbones and brow bone.</p><h3>Step 5: Apply Blush</h3><p>Choose a blush that complements your skin tone and apply it to the apples of your cheeks. Smile to locate the apples of your cheeks and apply the blush in a circular motion. Blend it well so that it looks natural.</p><h3>Step 6: Apply Eyeshadow</h3><p>Choose an eyeshadow palette that complements your skin tone and apply it to your eyelids. Use a light shade on your lid and a darker shade on your crease to create depth. Blend it well so that there are no harsh lines.</p><h3>Step 7: Apply Mascara</h3><p>Apply mascara to your lashes to create volume and length. Start at the base of your lashes and wiggle the wand upwards to the tips. Repeat for a more dramatic effect.</p><h3>Step 8: Apply Lipstick or Lip Gloss</h3><p>Finish off your look with a lipstick or lip gloss that complements your skin tone. Choose a shade that works well with your outfit and apply it evenly to your lips.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips and Tricks</h2><p>Here are some additional tips and tricks on how to apply makeup on a diamond shaped face:</p><ul><li>Use a highlighter to accentuate your cheekbones and brow bone.</li><li>Use a lip liner to create a more defined lip shape.</li><li>Choose a blush that complements your skin tone and apply it to the apples of your cheeks.</li><li>Use a brow pencil to fill in sparse areas of your eyebrows.</li><li>Use a setting spray to make your makeup last longer.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>What is a diamond-shaped face?</h3><p>A diamond-shaped face is characterized by a narrow forehead, high cheekbones, and a pointed chin.</p><h3>What makeup should I avoid if I have a diamond-shaped face?</h3><p>Avoid using dark or bold lipstick shades that can make your chin look more pointed.

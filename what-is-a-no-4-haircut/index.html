A No 4 haircut is a short buzz cut that leaves about 1/2 inch of hair on top of the head. It is one of the most popular haircuts for men and can be easily maintained at home or at a barbershop.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A No 4 haircut is the fourth guard size on a clipper. The guard size determines the length of the hair left on the head after the cut. The No 4 guard leaves about 1/2 inch of hair on top of the head. The sides and back of the head are usually tapered with a shorter guard size to create a clean and neat look. This haircut is suitable for men of all ages and can be worn with any hair type.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>To get a No 4 haircut, you will need a clipper with a No 4 guard size, a comb, and a pair of scissors. Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Preparation</h3><p>Start by washing your hair and towel drying it. Make sure your hair is free from any tangles or knots before you start cutting it.</p><h3>Step 2: Attach the No 4 Guard</h3><p>Attach the No 4 guard to your clipper. Ensure that the guard is securely attached and is not loose. Turn on the clipper and start from the nape of the neck.</p><h3>Step 3: Start Cutting</h3><p>Start cutting the hair using the clipper with the No 4 guard attached. Move the clipper in an upward motion towards the top of the head. Use the comb to lift the hair as you cut it to ensure that you get an even cut.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the Sides and Back</h3><p>Use a shorter guard size to taper the sides and back of the head. Start from the bottom and work your way up. Use the scissors to trim any stray hairs that the clipper may have missed.</p><h3>Step 5: Finishing Touches</h3><p>Use the scissors to trim any remaining hair on top of the head. Comb the hair to ensure that it is even and neat. Clean up the hairline around the ears and the back of the neck.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you maintain your No 4 haircut:</p><ul><li>Trim your hair every 2-3 weeks to maintain the length.</li><li>Use a good quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy.</li><li>Avoid using hot styling tools as they can damage your hair.</li><li>Visit a barber for any touch-ups or styling advice.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about the No 4 haircut:</p><h3>Can I get a No 4 haircut with curly hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can get a No 4 haircut with curly hair. However, you may need to use a shorter guard size to ensure that your hair does not look too long or bulky.</p><h3>Is a No 4 haircut suitable for all face shapes?</h3><p>Yes, a No 4 haircut is suitable for all face shapes. However, you may want to consult with your barber to see if there are any modifications that need to be made to suit your specific face shape.</p><h3>Can I style my No 4 haircut?</h3><p>Yes, you can style your No 4 haircut. Use a small amount of hair wax or pomade to create a textured look or a sleek style.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Maintaining a No 4 haircut is easy with the right hair care routine. Use a good quality shampoo and conditioner that is suitable for your hair type. Avoid using hot styling tools as they can damage your hair. Visit a barber every 2-3 weeks for any touch-ups or styling advice. With these tips, you can keep your No 4 haircut looking fresh and stylish.</p></article>

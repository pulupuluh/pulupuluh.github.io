Here are the steps to achieve the perfect messy hairstyle:</p><h3>1. Start with clean, towel-dried hair.</h3><p>You want your hair to be slightly damp but not wet. Use a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt to gently pat your hair dry. Avoid rubbing your hair vigorously with a towel, as this can cause damage and frizz.</p><h3>2. Apply a styling product.</h3><p>A matte paste or clay is ideal for creating texture and hold without looking too shiny or greasy. Rub a small amount between your palms and distribute evenly throughout your hair, focusing on the roots and mid-lengths. Avoid applying too much product, as this can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.</p><h3>3. Use your fingers to create volume and texture.</h3><p>Messy hair is all about creating a natural-looking texture and volume. Use your fingers to tousle and scrunch your hair, lifting the roots and creating a messy, undone look. You can also use a comb or brush to create more defined texture, but be gentle and avoid over-styling.</p><h3>4. Finish with a hairspray or sea salt spray.</h3><p>A light mist of hairspray or sea salt spray can help to set your style and add a beachy, undone texture. Hold the can about 6 inches away from your hair and spray lightly, focusing on the roots and mid-lengths. Avoid spraying too much, as this can weigh down your hair and make it look crunchy.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a more detailed step-by-step guide on how to style men's hair messy look:</p><h3>1. Shampoo and condition your hair.</h3><p>Start with clean, freshly washed hair. Use a sulfate-free shampoo and a hydrating conditioner to keep your hair healthy and nourished. Rinse thoroughly and gently pat your hair dry with a towel.</p><h3>2. Apply a styling product.</h3><p>Choose a matte paste or clay to create texture and hold. Rub a small amount between your palms and work through your hair, focusing on the roots and mid-lengths. Avoid applying too much product, as this can make your hair look greasy or weighed down.</p><h3>3. Use your fingers to create texture and volume.</h3><p>Tousle and scrunch your hair with your fingers, lifting the roots and creating a messy, undone look. You can also use a comb or brush to create more defined texture, but be gentle and avoid over-styling. Use your fingers to create separation and texture.</p><h3>4. Finish with a hairspray or sea salt spray.</h3><p>A light mist of hairspray or sea salt spray can help to set your style and add a beachy, undone texture. Hold the can about 6 inches away from your head and spray lightly, focusing on the roots and mid-lengths. Avoid spraying too much, as this can weigh down your hair and make it look crunchy.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Your Messy Look</h2><p>Now that you've achieved the perfect messy hairstyle, here are some tips for maintaining your look:</p><ul><li>Avoid washing your hair too often, as this can strip your hair of its natural oils and cause dryness.</li><li>Use a dry shampoo to refresh your hair between washes and absorb excess oil.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as this can cause damage and frizz.

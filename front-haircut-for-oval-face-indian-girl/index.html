An oval face is considered the most versatile face shape, and you can experiment with a variety of hairstyles.

Here's how you can get a perfect front haircut for your oval face:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose the Right Length</h3><p>The first step in getting a front haircut is to choose the right length. For an oval face, a shoulder-length haircut with layers framing your face is an excellent option. You can also opt for a short bob or a long layered cut.

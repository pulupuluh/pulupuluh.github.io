These guidelines include how we dress, how we behave, and even how we style our hair. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "Allah loves to see the effects of His blessings upon His servant." This means that we should take care of our appearance in a way that shows gratitude for the blessings that Allah has given us.</p><p>So why is a skin fade considered haram? The issue with a skin fade is that it involves cutting the hair very short on the sides and back of the head, while leaving the hair on top longer. This creates a contrast between the short and long hair that is considered immodest and draws attention to oneself. Additionally, the style has become associated with certain subcultures that promote values and lifestyles that are contrary to Islamic teachings.</p><p>It is important to note that not all haircuts that involve short hair on the sides and longer hair on top are haram. It is the extreme contrast of a skin fade that is problematic.</p><h3>What Does Haram Mean?</h3><p>Haram is an Arabic term that means "forbidden" or "prohibited." In Islam, there are certain actions and behaviors that are considered haram because they go against the teachings of the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).</p><h3>What Are Some Other Haircuts That Are Considered Haram?</h3><p>Aside from a skin fade, there are other haircuts that are considered haram in Islam. These include:</p><ul><li>Shaving the head completely</li><li>Creating designs or patterns in the hair</li><li>Leaving one part of the hair longer than the rest</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Can I Get a Haircut That Involves Short Hair on the Sides?</h3><p>Yes, you can get a haircut that involves short hair on the sides as long as it does not create an extreme contrast with the hair on top. A good rule of thumb is to keep the length difference between the sides and top to no more than two inches.</p><h3>What Should I Tell My Barber if I Want a Halal Haircut?</h3><p>You can simply tell your barber that you want a haircut that is modest and in accordance with Islamic teachings. You can also show them a picture of a haircut that you like but ask them to modify it to make it halal.</p><h3>What Should I Do if I Have Already Gotten a Skin Fade?</h3><p>If you have already gotten a skin fade or another haram haircut, you should repent and make a sincere effort to avoid making the same mistake in the future.

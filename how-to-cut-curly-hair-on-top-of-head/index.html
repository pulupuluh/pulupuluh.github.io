Curly hair tends to shrink when dry, so it's important to cut it when it's wet and stretched to get an accurate length. Here are the basic steps to follow:</p><h3>1. Start with clean, detangled hair</h3><p>Before you start cutting, make sure your hair is clean and free of tangles. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner specifically designed for curly hair to keep your curls hydrated and healthy. Detangle your hair with a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to avoid damaging your curls.</p><h3>2. Section your hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into four sections: two in the front and two in the back. Use hair clips to secure each section in place. This will make it easier to cut each section evenly and avoid cutting too much or too little hair.</p><h3>3. Cut your hair when wet</h3><p>Curly hair should be cut when it's wet and stretched to avoid uneven lengths. After washing your hair, apply a leave-in conditioner or a curl-defining cream to help define your curls. Use a wide-tooth comb to comb your hair straight, and then use hair clips to stretch out each section. </p><h3>4. Cut one section at a time</h3><p>Starting with one section at a time, comb your hair straight and hold it between your fingers. Use hair-cutting scissors to trim the ends of your hair. Start by cutting a small amount at a time and continue until you reach your desired length. Repeat the process with the other three sections of your hair.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><h3>Step 1: Wash and detangle your hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner. Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair, starting at the ends and working your way up to the roots. </p><h3>Step 2: Section your hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into four sections: two in the front and two in the back.

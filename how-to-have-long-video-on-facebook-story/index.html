Introduction 2. How to Have Long Video on Facebook Story 3. Step by Step Guide 4. Tips for Longer Videos on Facebook Story 5. FAQ about Long Videos on Facebook Story 6. Conclusion <h2>Introduction</h2> Facebook stories are a great way to share your daily life with your friends and followers. However, the one-minute time limit can be quite frustrating, especially if you want to share a longer video. Fortunately, there are ways to bypass this limit and have longer videos on Facebook stories. In this article, we will show you how to have long video on Facebook story and share some tips on how to make the most of this feature. <h2>How to Have Long Video on Facebook Story</h2> To have long video on Facebook story, you need to use a third-party app. There are many apps available for iOS and Android that allow you to split your longer video into multiple 15-second clips and upload them as a single story. Some of the popular apps include CutStory, Story Cutter, and Continual. <h3>Step by Step Guide</h3> Here is a step-by-step guide on how to have long video on Facebook story using the CutStory app: 1. Download and install the CutStory app on your phone. 2. Open the app and select the video you want to upload. 3. Choose the aspect ratio for your video (9:16 for stories). 4. Select the duration of each clip (15 seconds for Facebook stories). 5. Cut your video into multiple clips using the app. 6. Save the clips to your phone's camera roll. 7. Open the Facebook app and create a new story. 8. Select the first clip from your camera roll and upload it. 9. Do the same for the remaining clips until you have uploaded the entire video. <h2>Tips for Longer Videos on Facebook Story</h2> Here are some tips to help you make the most of your longer videos on Facebook story: - Plan your video ahead of time and make sure it tells a story. - Use captions, stickers, and emojis to make your story more engaging. - Use high-quality footage and make sure the audio is clear. - Keep the clips short and sweet – 15 seconds is not a lot of time, so make every second count. - Don't forget to add a call-to-action at the end of your story, such as a link to your website or social media profile. <h2>FAQ about Long Videos on Facebook Story</h2> Q: Can I upload a longer video directly to Facebook story without using a third-party app? A: No, the maximum duration for a video on Facebook story is one minute. You need to use a third-party app to upload longer videos. Q: Are there any other apps besides CutStory that I can use to upload longer videos on Facebook story? A: Yes, there are many other apps available for iOS and Android, such as Story Cutter and Continual. Q: Will my friends and followers be able to see the entire video on Facebook story? A: Yes, your friends and followers will be able to see the entire video, but they will need to swipe up to watch the remaining clips. <h2>Conclusion</h2> Having longer videos on Facebook story can be a great way to share your experiences with your friends and followers. By using a third-party app and following some simple tips, you can make the most of this feature and create engaging and entertaining stories. So, go ahead and give it a try – your audience will love it! </article>

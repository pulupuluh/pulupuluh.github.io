Or perhaps you're looking to try a new style that's easy to maintain? Whatever your reason may be, cutting your own hair can be a daunting task, especially if you're new to it. However, with the right tools and techniques, you can achieve a short back and sides haircut that looks just as good as a professional one. In this guide, we'll show you how to cut hair short back and sides in a relaxed and easy-to-understand language. Let's get started!</p><h2>What You'll Need</h2><p>Before we begin, it's essential to have the right tools on hand. Here's what you'll need:</p><ul><li>Clippers</li><li>Scissors</li><li>Comb</li><li>Haircutting cape or towel</li><li>Clip or hair tie</li><li>Mirror</li></ul><h2>How to Cut Hair Short Back and Sides</h2><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair and drying it completely. This will make it easier to cut and will give you a better idea of how it will look when it's finished. </p><h3>Step 2: Section the Hair</h3><p>Using the comb, divide your hair into three sections: the top, the back, and the sides. Use a clip or hair tie to secure the top section on the crown of your head. </p><h3>Step 3: Cut the Back</h3><p>Start with the back section. Use the clippers with a #2 guard to trim the hair from the nape of your neck to the crown of your head. Make sure to go slow and steady, using smooth strokes. </p><h3>Step 4: Blend the Sides</h3><p>Next, move on to the sides. Using the clippers with the same guard, trim the hair from the bottom of the sides to the top. To blend the hair, use the clippers without a guard and move them upward from the bottom to the top. Repeat this process until the hair is blended evenly. </p><h3>Step 5: Cut the Top</h3><p>Unclip the top section of your hair and comb it forward. Using the scissors, cut the hair to your desired length. To add texture, you can use point-cutting or razor-cutting techniques. </p><h3>Step 6: Check for Evenness</h3><p>After you've finished cutting, check for evenness and make any necessary adjustments. Use the mirror to check the back and sides, and the front-facing mirror to check the top. </p><h2>Tips for Cutting Hair Short Back and Sides</h2><ul><li>Start with a longer guard size and work your way down if you want a shorter cut.</li><li>Don't cut too much hair at once; it's easier to trim more than to add hair back.</li><li>Use the comb to guide the clippers and ensure an even cut.</li><li>Don't forget to clean your tools after each use to prevent the spread of bacteria.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can I cut my hair short back and sides with just scissors?</h3><p>While it's possible to cut your hair with just scissors, it's much easier and quicker to use clippers. Clippers allow you to cut through thick hair and create an even cut, which can be difficult to achieve with scissors alone.</p><h3>How often should I cut my hair short back and sides?</h3><p>It depends on how fast your hair grows and how short you want to keep it. Generally, you should trim your hair every 4-6 weeks to maintain the style.</p><h2>Hair Care After Cutting</h2><p>After cutting your hair short back and sides, it's important to take care of it properly. Use a shampoo and conditioner that's suitable for your hair type, and avoid using too much heat when styling. To keep your hair looking its best, consider using a hair oil or serum to add shine and moisture.</p><p>Cutting your own hair can be intimidating, but with practice and patience, you can achieve a short back and sides haircut that looks great. By following these steps, tips, and FAQs, you'll be well on your way to a stylish and low-maintenance haircut that you can be proud of. Happy cutting!</p></article>

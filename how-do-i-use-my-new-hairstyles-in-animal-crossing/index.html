Once you have a new hairstyle, head to a mirror in your house or visit Harriet at Shampoodle to change your hairstyle. </p><p> To change your hairstyle at a mirror, simply stand in front of it and press A. Choose "Change Look" and then "Haircut." You'll be able to choose from any of the hairstyles you've unlocked. </p><p> If you'd rather visit Harriet at Shampoodle, she'll be able to offer you more customization options, including hair color and eye color. Keep in mind that Harriet will only offer these options once you've changed your hairstyle at least once. </p><h2> Step by Step </h2><p> Here's a step-by-step guide on how to change your hairstyle in Animal Crossing: </p><ol><li> Unlock a new hairstyle by purchasing it from the Nook Stop terminal in Resident Services. </li><li> Head to a mirror in your house or visit Harriet at Shampoodle. </li><li> Stand in front of the mirror and press A. </li><li> Choose "Change Look" and then "Haircut." </li><li> Choose the hairstyle you want to use. </li><li> If you're at Shampoodle, choose any additional customization options you want, such as hair color or eye color. </li><li> Confirm your new look and enjoy your new hairstyle! </li></ol><h2> Tips </h2><p> Here are some tips to keep in mind when using your new hairstyles in Animal Crossing: </p><ul><li> Experiment with different hairstyles to find the one that best suits your character. </li><li> Don't be afraid to mix and match different hairstyles with different outfits. </li><li> Consider using accessories like hats or headbands to complement your hairstyle. </li><li> Remember that your hairstyle can be changed at any time, so don't stress too much about making the "perfect" choice. </li></ul><h2> FAQ </h2><p> Here are some frequently asked questions about using new hairstyles in Animal Crossing: </p><h3> How many hairstyles are in Animal Crossing? </h3><p> There are currently over 70 different hairstyles in Animal Crossing, so there's plenty to choose from! </p><h3> Can I change my hair color in Animal Crossing? </h3><p> Yes, you can change your hair color by visiting Harriet at Shampoodle. </p><h3> Do I need to pay to change my hairstyle? </h3><p> Yes, you'll need to purchase new hairstyles from the Nook Stop terminal in Resident Services.

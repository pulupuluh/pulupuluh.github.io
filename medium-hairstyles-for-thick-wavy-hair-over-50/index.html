Don't worry; there are plenty of options out there. In this article, we'll be discussing some of the best medium hairstyles for thick wavy hair over 50. Whether you're looking for a new look or want to refresh your current style, we've got you covered.</p><h2> Description </h2><p>Thick wavy hair can be a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it's full of volume and texture. On the other hand, it can be difficult to manage and style. If you're over 50, you may be looking for a hairstyle that's easy to maintain but still looks great. Medium hairstyles are a great option for those who want something versatile and low-maintenance.</p><h2> How to </h2><p>Before we dive into the hairstyles, it's important to understand how to care for your thick wavy hair. First and foremost, make sure you're using the right products. Look for shampoos and conditioners that are specifically designed for thick or wavy hair. These products will help to tame frizz and enhance your natural texture.</p><p>When it comes to styling, avoid using heat tools as much as possible. Heat can damage your hair and cause it to become brittle and dry. Instead, opt for air-drying or using a diffuser on your blow dryer. If you must use heat, make sure to use a heat protectant spray first.</p><h2> Step by Step </h2><h3> 1. Layered Bob </h3><p>A layered bob is a great option for those with thick wavy hair. This style adds dimension and texture to your hair while also keeping it manageable. To achieve this look, ask your stylist for a chin-length bob with layers throughout. </p><h3> 2. Shaggy Layers </h3><p>If you're looking for something a little more edgy, consider a shaggy layered style. This look features choppy layers and lots of texture. To achieve this look, ask your stylist for layers throughout your hair and point-cut the ends to create a choppy, textured look.</p><h3> 3. Shoulder-Length Waves </h3><p>A shoulder-length style is a great option for those who want something low-maintenance but still stylish. To achieve this look, ask your stylist for a shoulder-length cut with long layers throughout. Use a curling iron or wand to add loose waves for a beachy vibe.</p><h3> 4. Long Layers </h3><p>If you prefer longer hair, consider a style with long layers. This look adds volume and movement to your hair while also keeping it manageable. To achieve this look, ask your stylist for long layers throughout your hair.</p><h2> Tips </h2><p>When it comes to styling your medium hairstyle, there are a few tips to keep in mind. First, use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair when it's wet. This will help to prevent breakage and damage. Second, use a lightweight styling product to enhance your natural texture without weighing down your hair. Finally, embrace your natural texture and don't be afraid to let your hair air-dry.</p><h2> FAQ </h2><h3> Q. What hairstyles are best for thick wavy hair over 50? </h3><p> A. Medium hairstyles are a great option for those with thick wavy hair over 50. Layered bobs, shaggy layers, shoulder-length waves, and long layers are all great options.</p><h3> Q. How can I care for my thick wavy hair? </h3><p> A. Use products specifically designed for thick or wavy hair, avoid using heat tools as much as possible, and use a heat protectant spray when you do use heat. </p><h2> Hair Care </h2><p> Proper hair care is essential for maintaining healthy, beautiful hair. Make sure to wash your hair regularly with a gentle shampoo and conditioner. Avoid using hot water, as it can strip your hair of its natural oils. Instead, use lukewarm water to help preserve your hair's health.</p><p>When it comes to styling, use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair when it's wet.

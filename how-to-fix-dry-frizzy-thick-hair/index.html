It can also be prone to breakage and split ends. The problem is often caused by a lack of moisture in the hair, which can be due to a variety of factors such as overuse of heat-styling tools, exposure to harsh chemicals, and even genetics.</p><p>To fix dry frizzy thick hair, you need to rehydrate your hair and restore its natural oils. This can be done through a combination of hair care techniques and lifestyle changes.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Fix Dry Frizzy Thick Hair</h2><p>The following are steps you can take to fix dry frizzy thick hair:</p><h3>1. Use a Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner</h3><p>Look for a shampoo and conditioner that are specifically designed for dry hair. These products contain ingredients that can help to hydrate and nourish your hair, such as argan oil, shea butter, and coconut oil. Avoid products that contain sulfates, as these can strip your hair of its natural oils.</p><h3>2. Deep Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Deep conditioning is a great way to restore moisture to your hair.

Avoid Heat-Styling Tools</h3><p>Heat-styling tools such as flat irons and curling irons can cause damage to your hair, making it even drier and frizzier. Try to avoid using these tools as much as possible, and when you do use them, use a heat protectant spray to minimize damage.</p><h3>4. Use a Leave-In Conditioner</h3><p>A leave-in conditioner can help to keep your hair hydrated throughout the day. Apply a small amount of leave-in conditioner to your hair after washing and conditioning it, and leave it in until your next wash.</p><h3>5.

Aim to trim your hair every 6-8 weeks.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>The following is a step-by-step guide to fixing dry frizzy thick hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Shampoo and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Wet your hair and apply shampoo, massaging it into your scalp.

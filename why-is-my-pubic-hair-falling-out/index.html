One of the most common causes is hormonal changes, which can happen during puberty, pregnancy, menopause, or as a side effect of hormonal therapy. Hormonal changes can affect the growth and thickness of hair, including pubic hair.</p><p>Another cause of pubic hair loss is medical conditions, such as alopecia areata or thyroid disorders. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes hair loss on the scalp and other areas of the body, including the pubic area.

If a medical condition is causing your hair loss, you may need to undergo treatment for that condition.</p><p>To prevent further damage to your hair, avoid excessive grooming and use gentle products on your pubic area. If you need to remove hair, opt for methods that are less harsh, such as trimming with scissors or using a depilatory cream.

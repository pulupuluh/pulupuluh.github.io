If you're looking for a hair tool that can style and dry your hair at the same time, then a rotating hot air brush is an excellent choice. In this post, we'll go through the best rotating hot air brushes of 2020, how to use them, and some useful tips and tricks. So, let's get started!</p><h2>What is a Rotating Hot Air Brush?</h2><p>A rotating hot air brush is a hair styling tool that combines a hairbrush and a hair dryer in one device. It uses hot air to dry your hair while the rotating brush head styles and smooths your hair. It's an excellent tool for anyone who wants to achieve salon-quality hair at home without spending a lot of time and money.</p><h2>How to Use a Rotating Hot Air Brush?</h2><p>Using a rotating hot air brush is easy and straightforward. Here's how:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Before using a rotating hot air brush, make sure your hair is clean and towel-dried. If your hair is still wet, it will take longer to dry and style.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Heat Protectant</h3><p>To protect your hair from heat damage, apply a heat protectant spray or serum before using the hot air brush.</p><h3>Step 3: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into small sections using hair clips. This will make it easier to style and dry your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Start Styling</h3><p>Turn on the rotating hot air brush and select the temperature and speed settings that work best for your hair. Start styling your hair from the roots to the ends using the rotating brush head. Repeat the process for each section of your hair until you achieve the desired look.</p><h2>Tips and Tricks</h2><p>Here are some tips and tricks to help you get the most out of your rotating hot air brush:</p><h3>Tip 1: Choose the Right Size</h3><p>When choosing a rotating hot air brush, consider the size of the brush head. A smaller brush head is ideal for short hair, while a larger brush head is better suited for long hair.</p><h3>Tip 2: Use the Right Products</h3><p>Using the right hair products can make a big difference in how your hair looks and feels. Use a heat protectant spray or serum to protect your hair from heat damage, and a hair styling product to help hold your style in place.</p><h3>Tip 3: Clean Your Brush Head</h3><p>After using your rotating hot air brush, clean the brush head to remove any hair, dirt, or product buildup. This will help keep your brush head in good condition and ensure that it works properly the next time you use it.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q1: Can I use a rotating hot air brush on wet hair?</h3><p>A: It's best to use a rotating hot air brush on towel-dried hair to avoid damage and achieve better results.</p><h3>Q2: Can I use a rotating hot air brush every day?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can use a rotating hot air brush every day, but make sure to use heat protectant products to prevent damage to your hair.</p><h3>Q3: Can I use a rotating hot air brush on all hair types?</h3><p>A: Yes, a rotating hot air brush can be used on all hair types, but it's important to choose the right temperature and speed settings for your hair type.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Using a rotating hot air brush can be a great addition to your hair care routine. However, it's important to take care of your hair to keep it healthy and looking its best. Here are some tips:</p><h3>Tip 1: Wash Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>Wash your hair regularly to keep it clean and healthy. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner that's suited for your hair type.</p><h3>Tip 2: Use a Hair Mask</h3><p>Using a hair mask once a week can help nourish and hydrate your hair, leaving it soft and shiny.</p><h3>Tip 3: Avoid Heat Damage</h3><p>Using too much heat on your hair can cause damage and make it look dull and frizzy. Use heat styling tools sparingly and always use a heat protectant product.</p><p>That concludes our guide to the best rotating hot air brush of 2020. We hope you found this post helpful and informative. Using a rotating hot air brush can be a game-changer in your hair styling routine, so give it a try and see the difference for yourself!</p></article>

This means that you may need to cut the hair a bit shorter than you would if you were cutting it dry. Additionally, because curly hair can have different curl patterns and textures, it’s important to take this into account when cutting.</p><p>Now, let’s get into the steps for cutting curly hair wet.</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition the Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning the hair as you normally would. This will help remove any product buildup and make it easier to see the curls.</p><h3>Step 2: Detangle the Hair</h3><p>Once the hair is clean and conditioned, use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle the hair. This will make it easier to section off the hair and cut it evenly.</p><h3>Step 3: Section the Hair</h3><p>Section the hair into four sections: two in the front and two in the back. Use clips to secure each section.</p><h3>Step 4: Begin Cutting</h3><p>Starting with one section, comb the hair straight down and cut the ends straight across. Use the first cut as a guide for the rest of the section. Repeat this process for each section.</p><h3>Step 5: Check for Evenness</h3><p>Once you’ve finished cutting all sections, check for evenness. Make sure both sides are even and adjust as needed.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Now that we’ve gone over the basics of cutting curly hair wet, let’s get into a more detailed step-by-step guide.</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition the Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning the hair as you normally would.

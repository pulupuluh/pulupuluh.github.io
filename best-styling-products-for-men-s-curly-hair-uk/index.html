The right styling products can help to define your curls, reduce frizz, and add shine. It's important to choose products that work well with your hair type and texture.

Avoid using a towel, as this can cause frizz.</p><h3>Step 4: Diffuse Your Hair</h3><p>Use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your hair. This will help to add volume and definition to your curls.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Finish with a light hairspray to hold your curls in place.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>Now that you know how to style curly hair, let's take a look at the best styling products for men's curly hair in the UK.

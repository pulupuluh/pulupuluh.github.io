It's a popular choice for many women because it's versatile, easy to maintain, and looks great on all face shapes. If you want to give your bob a new twist, why not try cutting it so it curls under? This style is perfect for those who want a more rounded, softer look. In this article, we'll show you how to cut a bob so it curls under in easy-to-follow steps.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The curled-under bob is a flattering hairstyle that frames the face and adds volume to the hair. This style works best on those with straight or slightly wavy hair. The key to achieving the perfect curled-under look is to cut the hair at an angle so that the ends are slightly shorter in the back and longer in the front. This creates a natural curve that curls under, giving the hair a soft, bouncy look.</p><h2>How to Cut a Bob So It Curls Under</h2><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry the Hair</h3><p>First, start by washing and drying your hair. This will make it easier to cut and style. Use a shampoo and conditioner that is suitable for your hair type. Blow-dry your hair until it is completely dry.</p><h3>Step 2: Section the Hair</h3><p>Next, section your hair into four parts: the front, the back, and each side. Use hair clips to keep each section separate.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the Back</h3><p>Start by cutting the back section of your hair. Use a comb to separate a small section of hair at the nape of your neck. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut it straight across at a slight angle. Repeat this process for the rest of the back section, making sure to cut each section slightly shorter than the previous one.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the Sides</h3><p>Next, move on to the side sections of your hair. Hold a small section of hair between your fingers and cut it at the same angle as the back section. Repeat this process for the other side.</p><h3>Step 5: Cut the Front</h3><p>Finally, it's time to cut the front section of your hair. This is the section that will frame your face, so it's important to get it right. Use a comb to separate a small section of hair at the front. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut it at a slight angle so that it is longer at the front than at the back. Repeat this process for the other side.</p><h3>Step 6: Check the Length</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting your hair, check the length to make sure it's even. If you notice any uneven sections, go back and trim them until they are the same length as the rest of your hair.</p><h3>Step 7: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Now that you've cut your hair, it's time to style it. Blow-dry your hair using a round brush to create a curled-under look. You can also use a curling iron to add more curls if you want a more dramatic look.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect curled-under bob:</p><ul><li>Use sharp scissors to ensure a clean cut.</li><li>Start with a longer length and gradually cut shorter to avoid cutting off too much hair.</li><li>Use a mirror to check the back of your hair while cutting.</li><li>Don't cut your hair when it's wet, as this can cause it to shrink and appear shorter when it dries.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Can I cut a curled-under bob on curly hair?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can, but it may require more work to maintain the shape. It's best to consult with a stylist who is experienced in cutting curly hair.</p><h3>Q: How often should I trim my curled-under bob?</h3><p>A: It's recommended to trim your hair every 6-8 weeks to maintain the shape and prevent split ends.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>To keep your curled-under bob looking its best, it's important to take good care of your hair. Use a shampoo and conditioner that is suitable for your hair type, and avoid using too much heat when styling your hair. You can also use a hair mask once a week to keep your hair healthy and hydrated.</p><p>With these tips and tricks, you'll be able to cut a bob so it curls under like a pro. Give it a try and see how it transforms your look!</p></article>

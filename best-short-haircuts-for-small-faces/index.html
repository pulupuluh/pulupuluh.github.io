However, if you're ready for a bold new look, the pixie cut can be a great choice!</p><h3>The Bob Cut</h3><p>The bob cut is another classic short hairstyle that can be a great option for small faces. This style typically features hair that is cut to chin-length or just above the shoulders, and it can be customized with layers, bangs, or other details. The bob cut is versatile and can work well for a variety of face shapes, including small faces.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind with the bob cut is that it may require more maintenance than some other short haircuts.

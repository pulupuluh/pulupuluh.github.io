Face Shape</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, square face shapes have strong, angular jawlines and wide foreheads. The key to choosing the right haircut is to soften these features by adding volume and texture to the hair. Avoid haircuts that are too short or too flat, as they can make your face appear even more angular.</p><h3>2. Hair Texture</h3><p>The texture of your hair can also play a role in determining the best short haircut for square face female 2020. If you have fine hair, you may want to opt for a layered bob or pixie cut that adds volume and movement to your hair. If you have thick or curly hair, a short bob or shaggy cut can help reduce bulk and create a more balanced look.</p><h3>3. Personal Style</h3><p>Ultimately, the perfect short haircut for square face female 2020 is one that makes you feel confident and comfortable. Consider your personal style and the image you want to project when choosing a haircut.

That's why it's important to experiment and find what works best for you.

You can also try braiding or twisting your hair into a low-maintenance style.</p><h3>Q: How can I make my hair look less greasy?</h3><p>A: Use a dry shampoo to absorb excess oil, and avoid touching your hair too much throughout the day.

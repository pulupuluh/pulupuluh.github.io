Use gentle hair products</h3><p>Avoid using harsh hair products that can damage your hair and scalp. Use gentle shampoos and conditioners that are free from sulfates and other harsh chemicals.</p><h3>4.

These procedures can help to restore the appearance of thinning hair on the top of your head.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help prevent hair loss on the top of your head:</p><h3>1. Massage your scalp</h3><p>Massaging your scalp can help to stimulate hair growth and improve circulation to the hair follicles.</p><h3>2.

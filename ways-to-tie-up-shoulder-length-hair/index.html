You don't have enough length to create elaborate updos, but you also don't want to leave your hair down all the time. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to tie up shoulder length hair that are both easy and relaxed. In this article, we'll explore 10 different styles that are perfect for casual days or even special occasions.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#style1">Messy Bun</a></li><li><a href="#style2">Half-Up Half-Down</a></li><li><a href="#style3">Side Braid</a></li><li><a href="#style4">Low Ponytail</a></li><li><a href="#style5">Top Knot</a></li><li><a href="#style6">Fishtail Braid</a></li><li><a href="#style7">French Twist</a></li><li><a href="#style8">Twisted Half-Up</a></li><li><a href="#style9">Bubble Ponytail</a></li><li><a href="#style10">Braided Crown</a></li></ol><h2 id="style1">1. Messy Bun</h2><p>The messy bun is one of the most popular ways to tie up shoulder length hair. It's effortless, chic, and perfect for those days when you don't have a lot of time to spend on your hair. To achieve this look, gather your hair into a high ponytail, then twist it into a bun. Don't worry about making it perfect— the messier, the better! Secure the bun with a hair tie and pull out a few strands around your face for a relaxed vibe.</p><h2 id="style2">2. Half-Up Half-Down</h2><p>The half-up half-down style is another classic look that's perfect for shoulder length hair. Simply take the top half of your hair and pull it back into a ponytail, leaving the rest of your hair down. You can secure the ponytail with a hair tie and add some volume to the crown of your head by teasing your hair. This style is versatile and can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion.</p><h2 id="style3">3. Side Braid</h2><p>A side braid is a simple and elegant way to tie up shoulder length hair. Start by sweeping all of your hair to one side, then divide it into three sections. Begin braiding the hair, incorporating new sections as you go. Secure the braid with a hair tie and pull out a few strands for a more relaxed look. You can also loosen the braid by gently tugging on the sections to create a more voluminous and textured look.</p><h2 id="style4">4. Low Ponytail</h2><p>The low ponytail is a classic way to tie up shoulder length hair that will never go out of style. To achieve this look, gather your hair at the nape of your neck and secure it with a hair tie. You can leave the ponytail sleek and smooth for a more polished look, or add some texture by teasing the crown of your head or pulling out a few strands around your face.</p><h2 id="style5">5. Top Knot</h2><p>The top knot is a favorite among fashionistas and is perfect for those days when you want to look stylish but don't have a lot of time to spend on your hair. To achieve this look, gather your hair into a high ponytail at the crown of your head, then twist it into a bun. Secure the bun with a hair tie and pull out a few strands to frame your face. You can also add some texture to the bun by teasing it with a comb or your fingers.</p><h2 id="style6">6. Fishtail Braid</h2><p>The fishtail braid is a gorgeous way to tie up shoulder length hair that looks intricate but is surprisingly easy to create. Begin by dividing your hair into two sections, then take a small section from the outside of the left section and cross it over to the right side. Repeat this process with the right section, crossing a small section over to the left side. Continue braiding in this way, incorporating small sections of hair as you go, until you reach the end of your hair. Secure the braid with a hair tie and gently pull on the sections to create a more textured and voluminous look.</p><h2 id="style7">7. French Twist</h2><p>The French twist is a timeless and elegant way to tie up shoulder length hair for special occasions. Begin by gathering your hair into a ponytail at the nape of your neck, then twist the ponytail up towards the crown of your head. Tuck the ends of your hair into the twist and secure it with bobby pins. You can also add some volume to the crown of your head by teasing your hair before creating the twist.</p><h2 id="style8">8. Twisted Half-Up</h2><p>The twisted half-up style is a feminine and romantic way to tie up shoulder length hair. Begin by taking a small section of hair from one side of your head and twisting it towards the back. Secure the twist with a bobby pin, then repeat on the other side. Gather the two twists at the back of your head and secure them with a hair tie. You can leave the rest of your hair down or add some loose waves for a more textured look.</p><h2 id="style9">9. Bubble Ponytail</h2><p>The bubble ponytail is a playful and trendy way to tie up shoulder length hair. To achieve this look, gather your hair into a low ponytail and secure it with a hair tie. Then, take another hair tie and place it a few inches down from the first hair tie. Gently tug on the hair between the two hair ties to create a "bubble" effect. Repeat this process with additional hair ties until you reach the end of your hair. You can also add some texture to the ponytail by teasing it with a comb or your fingers.</p><h2 id="style10">10. Braided Crown</h2><p>The braided crown is a beautiful and bohemian way to tie up shoulder length hair. Begin by creating a center part and dividing your hair into two sections. Braid each section, starting at the nape of your neck and working your way up towards your temples. Secure the braids with hair ties and gently pull on the sections to create a more voluminous and textured look. Then, cross the braids over the top of your head and secure them with bobby pins. You can also add some loose waves to the ends of your hair for a more relaxed vibe.</p><h2>Hair Care Tips</h2><p>When tying up your shoulder length hair, it's important to take care of your hair to prevent damage and breakage.

Firstly, it can help to create a more defined jawline, making your face appear slimmer.

Finally, it can be a low-maintenance option that can save you time and effort in your daily routine.</p><p>When choosing a short hairstyle for a chubby face, it's important to consider your face shape and hair texture.

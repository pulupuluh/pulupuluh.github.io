They add volume and dimension to your hair, creating an illusion of width. Long layers work well with any hair texture, from fine to thick. They are also low maintenance and easy to style.</p><h3>2. Side-swept Bangs</h3><p>Side-swept bangs are a great way to frame your face and add volume to your hair. They work well with any long hairstyle, from straight to curly.

If you want beachy waves, use a curling iron with a large barrel. If you want straight hair, use a flat iron.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Finish your hairstyle with a light hold hairspray to keep it in place without making it stiff or crunchy.</p><h2>Tips to Maintain Long Hair for Oval Face</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you maintain your long hair:</p><h3>1.

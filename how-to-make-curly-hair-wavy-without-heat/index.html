Here are some hair care tips for curly hair:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair only once or twice a week to avoid stripping it of its natural oils.</li><li>Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair, as brushes can cause breakage and frizz.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools like flat irons and curling irons, as they can damage your hair and cause split ends.</li><li>Apply a hair mask once a week to nourish and hydrate your hair.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to get rid of split ends and maintain its shape.</li></ul><br/><p>By following these tips and techniques, you can make your curly hair wavy without using any heat.

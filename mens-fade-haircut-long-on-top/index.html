This style is perfect for men who want a clean, stylish look that's easy to maintain. The length of the hair on top can vary, but it's typically longer than the sides and back.</p><p>The fade on the sides and back can be high or low, depending on your preference. A high fade is when the hair is shorter above the ears and gradually gets longer towards the crown. A low fade is when the hair stays longer above the ears and gradually gets shorter towards the neckline.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>To get a mens fade haircut long on top, you'll need to visit a barber or hairstylist who is experienced in this style. Here are the steps they will follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Consultation</h3><p>The first step is to discuss your hair type, face shape, and the length you want your hair to be on top. Your barber will also ask you about your styling preferences and recommend a fade style that suits you.</p><h3>Step 2: Cutting the Sides and Back</h3><p>The barber will start by cutting the sides and back of your hair. They will use clippers to create a fade that gradually gets shorter towards the neckline. The length of the fade will depend on your preference.</p><h3>Step 3: Cutting the Top</h3><p>Once the sides and back are cut, your barber will move on to the top. They will cut your hair in a way that allows it to fall naturally on the top of your head. The length of the hair on top can vary, but it's typically longer than the sides and back.</p><h3>Step 4: Blending the Fade</h3><p>The final step is to blend the fade into the longer hair on top. The barber will use scissors and clippers to create a seamless transition between the two lengths of hair.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by step</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to styling a mens fade haircut long on top:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a shampoo and conditioner that suits your hair type. This will help to remove any product buildup and make your hair easier to style.</p><h3>Step 2: Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Use a towel to gently dry your hair, leaving it slightly damp. Avoid rubbing your hair vigorously with the towel, as this can cause damage and frizz.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply Product</h3><p>Apply a small amount of styling product to your hair, such as a pomade or wax. Rub the product between your palms and apply it evenly to your hair, starting at the roots and working your way up to the tips.</p><h3>Step 4: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Use a comb or your fingers to style your hair as desired. For a messy, textured look, use your fingers to tousle your hair and create volume. For a more polished look, use a comb to create a side part or slick your hair back.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips for maintaining and styling your mens fade haircut long on top:</p><ul><li>Visit your barber every 4-6 weeks to keep your haircut looking fresh.</li><li>Use a heat protectant spray before using hot styling tools like a blow dryer or flat iron.</li><li>Experiment with different styling products to find the one that works best for your hair type.</li><li>Avoid over-washing your hair, as this can strip it of its natural oils and lead to dryness.</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun and chlorine by wearing a hat or using a leave-in conditioner.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>How long does a mens fade haircut long on top last?</h3><p>A mens fade haircut long on top typically lasts 4-6 weeks before it starts to lose its shape and definition.</p><h3>Can I style my mens fade haircut long on top in different ways?</h3><p>Yes, a mens fade haircut long on top is versatile and can be styled in many different ways.

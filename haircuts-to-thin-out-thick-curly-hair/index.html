This haircut is ideal for thick curly hair as it thins out the hair and makes it more manageable.</p><h3>Long Bob Haircut</h3><p>A long bob, also known as a lob, is a shoulder-length haircut that's perfect for thick curly hair. It adds volume to your hair while keeping it manageable and easy to style.</p><h3>Tapered Haircut</h3><p>A tapered haircut involves cutting the hair shorter on the sides and back while leaving the hair longer on top.

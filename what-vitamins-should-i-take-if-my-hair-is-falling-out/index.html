The recommended daily intake of vitamin A is 700-900 mcg for women and 900-1200 mcg for men.</p><h2 id="vitamin-b-complex">Vitamin B Complex</h2><p>The B vitamins are crucial for healthy hair growth, as they help to produce red blood cells, which carry oxygen and nutrients to the scalp and hair follicles. A deficiency in any of the B vitamins can lead to hair loss. The B vitamins include thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin (B7), folic acid (B9), and cobalamin (B12).</p><h2 id="vitamin-c">Vitamin C</h2><p>Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps to protect the hair follicles from damage caused by free radicals.

The recommended daily intake of zinc is 8-11 mg for adults.</p><h2 id="omega-3">Omega-3</h2><p>Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for healthy hair growth, as they help to reduce inflammation and improve blood circulation.

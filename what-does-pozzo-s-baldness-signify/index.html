Pozzo's baldness can be seen as a symbol of the inevitable decline and decay of the human body, which is a central theme in existentialist literature.</p><h3>Power and Control</h3><p>Pozzo's baldness can also be interpreted as a symbol of his power and control over others. In the play, Pozzo is often abusive towards his servant, Lucky, and his bald head may represent his dominance and superiority over someone he sees as inferior.</p><h3>Humiliation and Shame</h3><p>Finally, Pozzo's baldness may signify feelings of humiliation and shame. In the second act of the play, Pozzo appears blind and helpless, and his once-powerful demeanor is reduced to one of vulnerability and weakness.

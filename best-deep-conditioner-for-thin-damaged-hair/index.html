Here are the basic steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Shampoo your hair</h3><p>Before applying the deep conditioner, shampoo your hair to remove any dirt, oil, or product buildup. Rinse thoroughly and gently towel-dry your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply the conditioner</h3><p>Apply a generous amount of deep conditioner to your hair, focusing on the ends and any areas that are particularly damaged. Use your fingers or a wide-toothed comb to distribute the conditioner evenly throughout your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Leave it in</h3><p>Most deep conditioners need to be left in your hair for at least 10-15 minutes to work effectively. Check the instructions on the product to see how long you should leave it in.</p><h3>Step 4: Rinse and style</h3><p>Rinse the conditioner out of your hair thoroughly, then style your hair as usual.

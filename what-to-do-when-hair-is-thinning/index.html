Here are some signs to watch out for:</p><ul><li>Increased hair shedding during brushing or showering</li><li>Visible thinning on the scalp</li><li>Widening of the part</li><li>Receding hairline</li><li>Bald spots</li></ul><h2>What To Do When Hair Is Thinning?</h2><p>There are several things you can do to help prevent hair thinning and promote hair growth.

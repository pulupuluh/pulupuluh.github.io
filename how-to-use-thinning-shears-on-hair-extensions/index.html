For example, if you have clip-in extensions, you cannot use thinning shears on them as they are not attached to your natural hair. However, if you have sew-in or bonded extensions, you can use thinning shears on them.</p><p>Thinning shears are used to remove bulk from hair, so they are especially useful if you have thick hair extensions. They work by cutting some of the hair strands while leaving others intact. This creates a textured, layered look that is perfect for those who want to add volume to their hair.</p><h3 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h3><p>Follow these steps to use thinning shears on hair extensions:</p><ol><li>Start by washing and drying your hair extensions.

Clip the top section of your hair extensions away from the bottom section.</li><li>Take a small section of hair from the bottom section and comb it straight down. This will help you see the length of the hair and identify the areas where you need to remove bulk.</li><li>Hold the thinning shears with the teeth facing upwards and the blades facing downwards. Cut into the hair at a 45-degree angle, starting from the middle of the hair strand and working your way downwards.

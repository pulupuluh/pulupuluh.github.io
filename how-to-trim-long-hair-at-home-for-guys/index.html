You'll need a pair of sharp scissors, hair clippers, a comb, and a mirror. Make sure the scissors are sharp so that you get a clean cut.</p><p>The first step is to wash and dry your hair. This will make it easier to cut and style. Once your hair is dry, comb it straight and divide it into sections. This will help you to work on one section at a time and ensure that you don't miss any parts.</p><h3>Using Scissors</h3><p>If you prefer to use scissors, start by trimming the ends of your hair. Hold a section of hair between your fingers and cut off the tips. You can also use the point-cutting technique, which involves cutting into the hair at an angle to give it texture and depth.</p><p>When cutting the sides of your hair, hold the section between your index and middle fingers and cut it at an angle. This will give you a layered look. Keep in mind that it's better to cut less hair at first and then trim more if necessary.</p><h3>Using Clippers</h3><p>If you're using hair clippers, start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter one. Comb your hair and use the clippers to trim the ends. Make sure to keep the clippers at an angle to avoid cutting too much hair at once.</p><p>When trimming the sides, use a shorter guard and blend the hair into the longer hair on top.

In this article, we will discuss the best short hairstyles for over 60 and provide you with tips on how to care for your hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Short haircuts are the most popular among women over 60, as they are easy to manage and maintain.

Here are some tips on how to choose the right short hairstyle:</p><h3>Consider Your Face Shape</h3><p>Before choosing a short hairstyle, consider your face shape.

If you have thick hair, opt for a short bob or a pixie cut with layers to thin out your hair.</p><h3>Consider Your Lifestyle</h3><p>When choosing a short hairstyle, consider your lifestyle. If you're busy and don't have time to style your hair every day, opt for a low-maintenance haircut.

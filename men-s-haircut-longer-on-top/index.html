This hairstyle has been around for a while and it's still going strong in 2023. In this guide, we'll show you how to get the perfect men's haircut longer on top, how to take care of it and answer some of the most frequently asked questions about this style.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The men's haircut longer on top is a hairstyle where the hair on the top of the head is left longer than the hair on the sides and back. This creates a contrast that makes the hair on the top stand out. This style is versatile and can be adapted to different hair types and face shapes.</p><h2>How to Get the Men's Haircut Longer on Top</h2><p>If you want to get the men's haircut longer on top, you'll need to visit a barber or stylist who knows how to cut this style. Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose the Right Length</h3><p>The length of your hair on the top will depend on your preference and the shape of your face. Some men prefer a longer, more dramatic look, while others prefer a more subtle look. Talk to your barber or stylist about what length would be best for you.</p><h3>Step 2: Decide on the Style</h3><p>The men's haircut longer on top can be styled in different ways.

The length will depend on your preference and the style you've chosen.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the Hair on the Top</h3><p>The hair on the top should be cut to the desired length using scissors. Your barber or stylist may use texturizing shears to add texture to the hair and create a more natural look.</p><h3>Step 5: Style the Hair</h3><p>Once the hair is cut, your barber or stylist will style it according to your preference. They may use products like pomade, wax, or gel to achieve the desired look.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining the Men's Haircut Longer on Top</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you maintain the men's haircut longer on top:</p> - Wash your hair regularly to keep it clean and healthy. - Use a conditioner to keep your hair soft and manageable. - Use a comb or brush to style your hair. - Use a hair product that suits your hair type and the style you've chosen. - Visit your barber or stylist regularly for touch-ups. <h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Q: Is the men's haircut longer on top suitable for all face shapes?</h3><p>A: The men's haircut longer on top can be adapted to different face shapes.

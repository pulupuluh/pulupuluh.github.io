You can position the ponytail high or low, depending on your preference. This works well for medium to long hair.</p><h3>Bun</h3><p>A bun is a more polished version of a ponytail. Instead of tying your hair with an elastic band, twist it into a coil and secure it with bobby pins. You can position the bun at the top or back of your head.

Simply gather the top half of your hair at the back of your head and tie it with an elastic band. You can leave the rest of your hair loose or style it as desired. This works well for medium to long hair.</p><h3>Headband</h3><p>A headband is a simple accessory that can help keep your hair back. Choose a headband that fits comfortably and doesn't slide off your head. You can wear it with your hair down or up in a ponytail or bun. This works well for short to medium hair.</p><h3>Clip or Bobby Pin</h3><p>A clip or bobby pin is a quick and easy way to secure your hair back.

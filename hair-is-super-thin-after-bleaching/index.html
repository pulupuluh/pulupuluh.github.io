However, bleaching can be very damaging to hair, especially if it has already been chemically relaxed. One of the most common side effects of bleaching is that hair can become super thin and fragile, making it prone to breakage and split ends.</p><p>If you have recently bleached your hair and are now dealing with super thin strands, don't panic! There are steps you can take to help strengthen and nourish your hair, so that it can grow back thicker and healthier than ever before.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Deal With Super Thin Hair After Bleaching</h2><p>Here are some tips and tricks for dealing with hair that has become super thin after bleaching:</p><h3>1. Give Your Hair a Break</h3><p>If your hair has become super thin after bleaching, it's important to give it a break from any further chemical treatments. Avoid coloring or relaxing your hair for at least a few months, to allow it time to recover and heal.</p><h3>2. Use a Protein Treatment</h3><p>One of the reasons that hair becomes super thin after bleaching is because the bleach strips away the natural proteins in the hair. To help restore these proteins, use a protein treatment once a week. This will help to strengthen your hair and prevent further breakage.</p><h3>3. Use a Deep Conditioning Treatment</h3><p>Bleaching can also strip away the natural oils in your hair, leaving it dry and brittle. To combat this, use a deep conditioning treatment once a week. This will help to nourish your hair and keep it hydrated, so that it can grow back thicker and stronger.</p><h3>4. Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons can further damage already fragile hair. Avoid using these tools as much as possible, or use them at a lower temperature setting. You can also use a heat protectant spray to help minimize damage.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide for dealing with super thin hair after bleaching:</p><h3>Step 1: Give Your Hair a Break</h3><p>Avoid any further chemical treatments, including coloring or relaxing your hair, for at least a few months.</p><h3>Step 2: Use a Protein Treatment</h3><p>Apply a protein treatment to your hair once a week to help restore the natural proteins that were stripped away by the bleach.</p><h3>Step 3: Use a Deep Conditioning Treatment</h3><p>Apply a deep conditioning treatment to your hair once a week to help nourish and hydrate your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Avoid using heat styling tools as much as possible, or use them at a lower temperature setting.

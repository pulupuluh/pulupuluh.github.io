One of the most important clubs in a golfer's bag is the wedge. A wedge is a short-range club that is used to hit shots from close to the green or from difficult lies. The 60-degree wedge is a popular choice among golfers, especially beginners. In this article, we will discuss the best 60 degree wedge for beginner golfers.</p><h2>What is a 60 Degree Wedge?</h2><p>A 60 degree wedge is a type of golf club with a loft angle of 60 degrees. This high loft angle makes it ideal for hitting high and short shots, especially from the sand or rough. It is also useful for hitting flop shots, which are high, soft shots that stop quickly on the green.</p><h2>How to Choose the Best 60 Degree Wedge for Beginner?</h2><p>Choosing the right wedge can be challenging, especially for beginners. Here are some factors to consider when choosing the best 60 degree wedge:</p><h3>1. Loft Angle</h3><p>The loft angle is the angle between the face of the club and the ground. A higher loft angle means the ball will go higher and shorter. For beginners, a 60-degree wedge is ideal as it provides enough loft to get the ball up in the air.</p><h3>2. Shaft Material</h3><p>The shaft material can affect the feel and performance of the club. Steel shafts are more durable and provide better control, while graphite shafts are lighter and can provide more distance. For beginners, a steel shaft is a good choice as it provides better feedback.</p><h3>3. Clubhead Design</h3><p>The clubhead design can affect the performance of the club. A wider sole and a larger clubface can provide more forgiveness, while a thinner sole and a smaller clubface can provide more control. For beginners, a wider sole and a larger clubface are ideal as they provide more forgiveness on mishits.</p><h2>Top 3 Best 60 Degree Wedge for Beginner</h2><h3>1. Callaway Mack Daddy CB Wedge</h3><p>The Callaway Mack Daddy CB Wedge is a great choice for beginners as it provides excellent forgiveness and control. It features a wide sole and a large clubface, which make it easy to hit from any lie. The club is made of high-quality materials and comes with a steel shaft for better feedback.</p><h3>2. Cleveland CBX 2 Wedge</h3><p>The Cleveland CBX 2 Wedge is another great option for beginners. It features a cavity back design, which provides excellent forgiveness on mishits. The club also has a wide sole and a large clubface, which make it easy to hit from any lie. The club is made of high-quality materials and comes with a steel shaft for better feedback.</p><h3>3. TaylorMade Hi-Toe Big Foot Wedge</h3><p>The TaylorMade Hi-Toe Big Foot Wedge is a unique wedge that provides excellent performance for beginners. It features a high toe design, which makes it easy to hit flop shots. The club also has a wide sole and a large clubface, which make it easy to hit from any lie. The club is made of high-quality materials and comes with a steel shaft for better feedback.</p><h2>Tips for Using a 60 Degree Wedge</h2><p>Here are some tips for using a 60 degree wedge:</p><h3>1. Practice Your Technique</h3><p>Using a 60 degree wedge requires a different technique than other clubs. Practice hitting different types of shots, such as high shots and flop shots, to improve your technique.</p><h3>2. Choose the Right Ball</h3><p>Using the right ball can affect the performance of the club. Choose a ball that provides enough spin to stop quickly on the green.</p><h3>3. Use the Bounce</h3><p>The bounce is the angle between the leading edge of the club and the ground. Using the bounce can help prevent digging and improve your shots from the sand or rough.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>1. What is the loft angle of a 60 degree wedge?</h3><p>The loft angle of a 60 degree wedge is 60 degrees.</p><h3>2. Can a 60 degree wedge be used for full shots?</h3><p>A 60 degree wedge is not designed for full shots. It is best used for short-range shots around the green.</p><h3>3. Should a beginner use a 60 degree wedge?</h3><p>Yes, a 60 degree wedge is a great club for beginners as it provides enough loft to get the ball up in the air.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Choosing the right wedge is essential for improving your game.

The Callaway Mack Daddy CB Wedge, Cleveland CBX 2 Wedge, and TaylorMade Hi-Toe Big Foot Wedge are all great options for beginners.

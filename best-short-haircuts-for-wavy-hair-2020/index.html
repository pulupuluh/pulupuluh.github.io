Or are you simply looking for a fresh and new hairstyle for your wavy locks? Look no further as we have compiled the best short haircuts for wavy hair in 2020. From bobs to pixies, we’ve got you covered. Read on to find out more!</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Wavy hair can be a blessing and a curse at the same time. While it’s beautiful to look at, it can also be challenging to manage, especially when it comes to styling. Fortunately, there are many trendy and stylish short haircuts that can help you tame your wavy locks and look your best every day. These haircuts not only accentuate your natural waves but also give you a chic and modern look. </p><h2>How to Choose the Right Short Haircut for Your Wavy Hair?</h2><p>Choosing the right haircut for your wavy hair can be a daunting task, but it’s not impossible. The key is to find a style that complements your face shape, hair texture, and lifestyle. Here are some tips to help you choose the right short haircut for your wavy hair.</p><h3>Step 1: Determine Your Face Shape</h3><p>The first step is to determine your face shape. You can do this by pulling your hair back and examining your face in the mirror. The four basic face shapes are round, square, oval, and heart-shaped.

Wavy hair can range from fine to coarse, and each texture has its own unique set of challenges. If you have fine wavy hair, you may want to opt for a layered bob that adds volume and movement to your hair. If you have thick wavy hair, a pixie cut with textured layers can help you manage your hair and make it look more polished.</p><h3>Step 3: Think About Your Lifestyle</h3><p>The third step is to think about your lifestyle.

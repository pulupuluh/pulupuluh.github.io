First, you'll need to choose the right tools, including a pair of sharp scissors, clippers, and a comb. You'll also need to have an idea of the style you want to create, as well as an understanding of how to use the tools to achieve that look. </p><h3>Choose the Right Style</h3><p>The first step in cutting women's short spiky hair is to choose the right style. There are many different styles to choose from, including a classic punk look, a messy layered style, or a sleek and modern cut. Once you've chosen a style, you'll need to gather the tools you'll need to achieve that look. </p><h3>Section the Hair</h3><p>The next step in cutting women's short spiky hair is to section the hair. You'll want to start at the back of the head and work your way forward, using a comb to create clean sections. This will help you keep the hair even and ensure that you don't miss any sections. </p><h3>Cut the Hair</h3><p>Once you've sectioned the hair, it's time to start cutting.

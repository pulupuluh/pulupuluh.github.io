Eating a balanced diet with plenty of vitamins and minerals will help your hair grow faster and stronger. Foods like salmon, eggs, spinach, and sweet potatoes are all great for hair health.</p><h3>3. Take Care of Your Hair</h3><p>Keep your hair clean and healthy by washing it regularly and using a good conditioner.

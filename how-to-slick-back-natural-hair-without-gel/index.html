Sleek Low Bun Tutorial On Type 4 Natural Hair [Video] via</u></center></a></figcaption></figure><p> If you're looking to achieve a sleek and polished look for your natural hair without using traditional hair gel, you're in luck. There are several techniques and products you can use to achieve this style. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to slick back natural hair without gel. </p><h2> How to Slick Back Natural Hair Without Gel </h2><h3> Step 1: Start with freshly washed hair </h3><p> Before you begin styling, make sure your hair is clean and free of any product buildup. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner to wash your hair, and towel dry it gently. </p><h3> Step 2: Apply a leave-in conditioner </h3><p> A leave-in conditioner will help moisturize your hair and make it more manageable for styling. Apply a small amount of leave-in conditioner to your hair, focusing on the ends and any particularly dry areas. </p><h3> Step 3: Use a styling cream </h3><p> Instead of traditional hair gel, use a styling cream to slick back your hair. Apply a small amount of cream to your fingertips and work it through your hair, starting at the roots and working your way to the tips. </p><h3> Step 4: Use a boar bristle brush </h3><p> A boar bristle brush is perfect for smoothing down your hair and creating a sleek look. Use the brush to comb your hair back, starting at the hairline and working your way towards the back of your head. </p><h3> Step 5: Secure with bobby pins </h3><p> Use bobby pins to secure your hair in place. Place the pins horizontally across your hairline, and then vertically along the sides of your head. </p><h2> Tips for Slicking Back Natural Hair Without Gel </h2><p> Here are a few additional tips to help you achieve the perfect slicked-back look without using gel: </p><ul><li> Use a light hand when applying styling products. You can always add more, but it's harder to take it away once it's in your hair. </li><li> Experiment with different styling creams to find one that works best for your hair type. </li><li> If you have particularly frizzy hair, consider using a serum in addition to a styling cream. </li><li> If you don't have a boar bristle brush, you can use a wide-tooth comb instead. </li></ul><h2> FAQ </h2><h3> Can I use gel if I want a stronger hold? </h3><p> Yes, you can use gel if you prefer a stronger hold. However, if you're looking for a more natural alternative to gel, try using a styling cream or pomade instead. </p><h3> How long will this style last? </h3><p> With the right products and techniques, this style can last for several days. However, you may need to touch up any flyaways or loose hairs as needed. </p><h3> Can I slick back my hair if it's short? </h3><p> Yes, you can slick back short hair using the same techniques outlined in this article. However, you may need to use less product and fewer bobby pins to achieve the desired look. </p><h2> Hair Care for Slicked-Back Hair </h2><p> To keep your hair healthy and looking its best, be sure to follow a regular hair care routine. This should include washing your hair regularly with a gentle shampoo and conditioner, using a leave-in conditioner to moisturize your hair, and protecting your hair from heat damage with a heat protectant spray. </p><p> With these tips and techniques, you can achieve a sleek and polished look for your natural hair without using traditional hair gel. Give it a try and see how it works for you! </p></article>

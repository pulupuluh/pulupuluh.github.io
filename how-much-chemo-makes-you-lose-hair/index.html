Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and avoid using hot water.</li><li>Use a soft brush or comb to avoid pulling your hair.</li><li>Avoid using hair products that contain harsh chemicals or alcohol.</li><li>Protect your scalp from the sun by wearing a hat or scarf.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Q: Will my hair grow back after chemo?</h3><p>A: Yes, your hair will grow back after chemo, but it may take several months.

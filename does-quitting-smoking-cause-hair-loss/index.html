Quitting smoking is one of the best things you can do for your health, and there are many resources available to help you quit. Some effective methods for quitting smoking include:</p><ul><li>Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)</li><li>Prescription medications such as varenicline (Chantix) or bupropion (Zyban)</li><li>Counseling or therapy</li><li>Support groups</li></ul><p>It's important to talk to your doctor about the best method for you, and to create a plan for quitting smoking that works for your individual needs.</p><h2>Does Quitting Smoking Cause Hair Loss?</h2><p>The short answer is no, quitting smoking does not cause hair loss. In fact, quitting smoking can actually improve hair health and promote hair growth. This is because smoking can damage hair follicles and reduce blood flow to the scalp, which can lead to hair loss and thinning. Quitting smoking can reverse this damage and improve overall hair health.</p><p>However, some people may experience temporary hair loss or shedding after quitting smoking.

When you quit smoking, your hair may go through a shedding phase as it transitions back to a normal growth cycle.

You'll need a pair of sharp scissors, a comb, and clippers with guards of various sizes. It's also a good idea to have a spray bottle filled with water and a towel handy.</p><p>Next, have your client sit in a comfortable chair, and drape a cape or towel over them to catch any hair. It's also a good idea to ask your client what kind of haircut they want, so you have a clear idea of what they're looking for.</p><h3 id="section1">Sectioning the Hair</h3><p>The first step in cutting straight male hair is to section the hair. Start by combing the hair straight down, and then part it down the middle from the forehead to the nape of the neck. Clip one side of the hair out of the way, and start cutting the other side.</p><p>Take a small section of hair from the top of the head, and use your fingers or a comb to hold it straight out from the head. Use your scissors to cut the hair to the desired length, working from the tips of the hair inward.</p><p>Continue cutting small sections of hair, moving from the top of the head to the sides and back. Make sure to keep your scissors angled downward, and take care not to cut too much off at once.</p><h3 id="section2">Cutting the Hair</h3><p>Once you've cut the top and sides of the hair, it's time to move on to the back. Comb the hair straight down, and use your clippers to trim the hair to the desired length. Start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter guard, depending on the length of hair you want to leave.</p><p>Work your way up the back of the head, using your clippers to create a smooth, even cut. Take care not to cut too high up the back of the head, as this can create an uneven line.</p><h3 id="section3">Blending and Texturizing</h3><p>Once you've cut the hair to the desired length, it's time to blend and texturize the hair. Use your scissors to cut into the hair, creating texture and movement. You can also use thinning shears to remove bulk and create a more natural look.</p><p>Blend the hair on the sides and back of the head by using your clippers without a guard. Move the clippers upward from the neck to the hairline, creating a smooth transition between the longer hair on top and the shorter hair on the sides and back.</p><h3 id="section4">Finishing Touches</h3><p>Once you've blended and texturized the hair, it's time for the finishing touches. Use your scissors to trim any stray hairs, and check for any uneven spots or lines. Use your clippers to clean up the hairline around the ears and neck.</p><p>Finally, spray the hair with water and comb it into place.

Other symptoms of ringworm include red, scaly patches on the scalp and itching.</p><h2 id="cause3">Traction Alopecia</h2><p>Traction alopecia is hair loss caused by pulling or tension on the hair. It is common in people who wear tight hairstyles, such as braids, weaves, or ponytails. Traction alopecia can cause round bald spots where the hair is pulled tightly.</p><h2 id="cause4">Scarring Alopecia</h2><p>Scarring alopecia is a type of hair loss that occurs when hair follicles are destroyed and replaced with scar tissue. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infections, autoimmune disorders, and burns. Scarring alopecia can cause round bald spots that may be permanent.</p><h2 id="cause5">Chemotherapy</h2><p>Chemotherapy is a common cancer treatment that can cause hair loss.

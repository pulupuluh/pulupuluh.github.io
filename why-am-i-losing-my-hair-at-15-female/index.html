Hormonal imbalances such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or thyroid disorders can also cause hair loss.</p><h3>Nutritional Deficiencies</h3><p>A balanced and healthy diet is essential for healthy hair growth. Nutritional deficiencies in iron, zinc, or biotin can cause hair loss. Eating a diet rich in protein, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats can promote hair growth.</p><h3>Stress</h3><p>Stress can cause hair loss in teenage girls. Academic pressure, family issues, or social anxiety can lead to hair loss. Practicing stress management techniques such as yoga, meditation, or exercise can help reduce stress levels.</p><h3>Hairstyling Practices</h3><p>Excessive hairstyling, heat styling, and chemical treatments such as relaxers or perms can cause hair damage and hair loss.

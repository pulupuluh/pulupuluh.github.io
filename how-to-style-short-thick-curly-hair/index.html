You want a cut that will enhance your natural curls and work with your hair’s thickness. A layered cut can help to add volume and definition to your curls, while a blunt cut can create a sleek, polished look.</p><p>Once you have the right cut, it’s time to start styling. Here are the basic steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with clean, conditioned hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner that is specifically designed for curly hair. This will help to keep your curls hydrated and defined.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply a styling product</h3><p>Apply a curl-enhancing product, such as a mousse or gel, to your damp hair. Work the product through your hair, starting at the roots and working your way to the ends.</p><h3>Step 3: Diffuse your hair</h3><p>Use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to dry your hair. Hold the diffuser close to your scalp, and use a low heat setting to avoid damaging your hair. This will help to enhance your curls and add volume.</p><h3>Step 4: Define your curls</h3><p>Use a curling iron or wand to define any sections of hair that need a little extra help. Wrap small sections of hair around the barrel of the curling iron or wand, and hold for a few seconds before releasing.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with a hair spray</h3><p>Spray your hair with a light hold hairspray to keep your curls in place and prevent frizz.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a more detailed step by step guide to styling short thick curly hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash your hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner.

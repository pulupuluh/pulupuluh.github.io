Therefore, it is important to choose the right bleach product and know how long to leave it in your hair.</p><h3>Choosing the Right Bleach Product</h3><p>When it comes to choosing a bleach product, it is important to opt for one that is specifically designed for Asian hair. This is because Asian hair tends to be more resistant to bleach than other hair types, so a stronger formula is needed.</p><p>Look for a bleach product that contains hydrogen peroxide, which is the active ingredient that lightens hair. The higher the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, the stronger the bleach will be. However, be careful not to choose a bleach with too high of a concentration, as this can cause severe damage to your hair.</p><h3>Determining How Long to Leave Bleach in Asian Hair</h3><p>Knowing how long to leave bleach in Asian hair is crucial to achieving the desired blonde shade without causing damage. The amount of time you leave the bleach in your hair will depend on several factors, including your hair's natural color, the strength of the bleach, and your desired level of lightness.</p><p>Generally, it is recommended to leave bleach in Asian hair for no more than 45 minutes. However, if your hair is particularly resistant to bleach, you may need to leave it in for up to an hour. It is important to check your hair every 10-15 minutes to ensure that it is not becoming too light or damaged.</p><h2 id="stepbystep">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to bleach Asian hair:</p><ol><li>Start with clean, dry hair.

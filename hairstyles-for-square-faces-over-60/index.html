Look no further! In this article, we'll discuss the best hairstyles for square faces over 60, how to achieve them, and hair care tips to keep your hair looking fabulous.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#description">Description</a></li><li><a href="#how-to">How To</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by Step</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ul><h2 id="description">Description</h2><p>Square faces are known for their strong jawlines and wide foreheads. If you have a square face over 60, you want to choose a hairstyle that softens these features while still looking stylish and age-appropriate. The right hairstyle can make you look younger and feel more confident.</p><h2 id="how-to">How To</h2><p>The first step in finding the perfect hairstyle is to determine your face shape. If you have a square face, you'll want to choose a hairstyle that adds volume to the top of your head and softens your jawline. A layered cut or a side-swept bang can achieve this effect.</p><h3>Layered Cut</h3><p>A layered cut is a great option for square faces over 60. Layers add volume and movement to your hair, drawing attention away from your jawline. Ask your stylist for long layers that start at your chin and frame your face. This will give you a soft, feminine look.</p><h3>Side-Swept Bang</h3><p>A side-swept bang is another great option for square faces over 60. Bangs draw attention to your eyes and soften your forehead, balancing out your jawline. Ask your stylist for a side-swept bang that starts at the top of your head and falls diagonally across your forehead.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>Here's how to achieve a layered cut:</p><ol><li>Wash and condition your hair.</li><li>Blow-dry your hair until it's about 80% dry.</li><li>Section your hair into four parts: top, left side, right side, and back.</li><li>Starting with the back section, use a round brush to brush your hair away from your face while blow-drying it. Repeat with the other sections.</li><li>Once your hair is dry, use a curling iron to add volume and movement to your layers.</li></ol><p>Here's how to achieve a side-swept bang:</p><ol><li>Wash and condition your hair.</li><li>Blow-dry your hair until it's about 80% dry.</li><li>Section off the front part of your hair that you want to turn into bangs.</li><li>Using a round brush, blow-dry your bangs to the side.</li><li>Once your hair is dry, twist your bangs away from your face and use a flat iron to set them in place. </li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><ul><li>Choose a hairstyle that complements your lifestyle. If you're active, choose a low-maintenance style that you can easily maintain.</li><li>Consider your hair texture when choosing a hairstyle. If you have fine hair, a layered cut can add volume. If you have thick hair, a blunt cut can help control frizz.</li><li>Experiment with different lengths and styles to find what works best for you.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>What hairstyles should I avoid if I have a square face?</h3><p>Avoid hairstyles that accentuate your strong jawline, such as blunt bobs or straight, center-parted hair. These styles can make your face look boxy and unbalanced.</p><h3>Can I still wear my hair long if I have a square face?</h3><p>Absolutely! Long hair can be very flattering on square faces. Just make sure to add layers to soften your features.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care</h2><p>To keep your hair looking its best, follow these tips:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to prevent damage and dryness.</li><li>Avoid using heat tools on your hair too often.</li><li>Get regular trims to keep your hair looking healthy and prevent split ends.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair hydrated.</li></ul><p>With these tips and tricks, you can find the perfect hairstyle for your square face over 60 and keep your hair looking healthy and vibrant.</p></article>

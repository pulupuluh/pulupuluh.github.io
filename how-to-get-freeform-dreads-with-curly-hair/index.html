This style is achieved by allowing the hair to naturally dread without the use of any styling products or techniques. While this may seem like an easy process, it can be difficult to achieve the desired look. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to getting freeform dreads with curly hair.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><p><a href="#how-to">How to Get Freeform Dreads with Curly Hair</a></p><p><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</a></p><p><a href="#tips">Tips for Maintaining Freeform Dreads</a></p><p><a href="#faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></p><p><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care for Freeform Dreads</a></p><h2 id="how-to">How to Get Freeform Dreads with Curly Hair</h2><p>Before we get into the steps to achieve freeform dreads, it's important to understand that this style requires patience and commitment. Freeform dreads can take anywhere from six months to a year to fully form, so be prepared for a long-term commitment. With that said, let's get started.</p><h3>Step 1: Stop Using Shampoo</h3><p>The first step in achieving freeform dreads is to stop using shampoo. Shampoo strips the hair of its natural oils, which are essential for helping the hair to naturally dread. Instead, use a natural conditioner or apple cider vinegar to cleanse the scalp and hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Let Your Hair Grow</h3><p>Next, let your hair grow out. The longer your hair, the easier it will be to form dreadlocks. As your hair grows, avoid brushing or combing it. This will allow the hair to naturally tangle and form dreads.</p><h3>Step 3: Separate the Dreads</h3><p>As your hair begins to tangle and form dreads, it's important to separate them to prevent them from merging together. Use your fingers to gently pull apart any dreads that are starting to merge together.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Now that you understand the basic steps to getting freeform dreads, let's break it down into a step-by-step guide.</p><h3>Step 1: Stop Using Shampoo</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, stop using shampoo and instead use a natural conditioner or apple cider vinegar to cleanse your scalp and hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Let Your Hair Grow</h3><p>Allow your hair to grow out without brushing or combing it.

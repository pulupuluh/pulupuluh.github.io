Here's how you can dry them: </p><ol><li> Gently towel-dry your hair extensions to remove excess water. </li><li> Use a hairdryer on a cool setting to dry the hair extensions. </li><li> Once they're dry, gently brush them to remove any tangles. </li></ol><p> Don't use a hairdryer on a hot setting as it can damage the adhesive tape and cause the hair extensions to slip or fall out. </p><h2> Tips for Sleeping with Tape-In Hair Extensions </h2><p> Here are some tips for sleeping with tape-in hair extensions: </p><ul><li> Always make sure your hair extensions are dry before going to bed. </li><li> Tie your hair extensions in a loose braid or ponytail to prevent tangling. </li><li> Use a silk or satin pillowcase to reduce friction and prevent breakage. </li><li> Avoid sleeping on wet hair as it can cause damage to your natural hair and hair extensions. </li></ul><h2> How to Care for Tape-In Hair Extensions </h2><p> Caring for your tape-in hair extensions is crucial to ensure they last longer and look better.

They are made of keratin and can be sprinkled onto the scalp to mimic the appearance of hair. They can be washed out with shampoo and reapplied as needed.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a step by step guide on how to fix bald spots on your hairline:</p><h3>Step 1: Identify the Cause of Baldness</h3><p>The first step is to identify the cause of your baldness.

Work the product through your hair, starting at the back and working your way to the front.</p><h3>3. Use your fingers to style your hair.</h3><p>Use your fingers to style your hair, creating texture and volume as you go. You can use a comb or brush to smooth down any flyaways, but try to keep the overall look natural and textured.</p><h3>4.

Pixie haircuts are versatile, easy to style, and can enhance your natural features. However, finding the best pixie haircut for over 60 can be challenging, as you want a style that flatters your face shape, hair texture, and lifestyle. In this article, we'll share some tips, ideas, and inspiration for the best pixie haircuts for over 60.</p><h2>How to Choose the Best Pixie Haircut for Over 60</h2><p>Before you book an appointment with your hairstylist, there are a few things to consider when choosing the best pixie haircut for over 60. Here are some factors to keep in mind:</p><h3>Face Shape</h3><p>The first thing to consider is your face shape, as it can affect how a pixie cut looks on you. For example, if you have a round face, you may want to opt for a longer pixie with side-swept bangs to elongate your features. If you have a square face, a textured pixie with layers can soften your jawline. If you have an oval face, you're lucky, as most pixie cuts can suit you.</p><h3>Hair Texture</h3><p>Your hair texture can also influence the type of pixie cut that works best for you. If you have fine hair, you may want to try a layered pixie with volume at the crown to add fullness. If you have thick hair, a choppy pixie with textured layers can reduce the weight and add movement. If you have curly or wavy hair, a short curly pixie can showcase your curls and frame your face.</p><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Lastly, your lifestyle can impact your choice of pixie cut. If you're low-maintenance and prefer a wash-and-go style, a short and simple pixie can be perfect for you. If you're more adventurous and love experimenting with styling products, a messy and edgy pixie can be a fun option. If you're somewhere in between, a classic and elegant pixie with a side part can be versatile and chic.</p><h2>Best Pixie Haircuts for Over 60</h2><p>Now that you know how to choose the best pixie haircut for over 60, let's explore some of the most popular and flattering styles.

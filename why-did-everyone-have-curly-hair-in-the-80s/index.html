Men and women alike sported big, voluminous curls that seemed to defy gravity. So what was behind this trend? Here's everything you need to know about why everyone had curly hair in the 80s.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The 80s were a time of excess and extravagance, and nowhere was this more evident than in the world of fashion and beauty. Big hair, bright colors, and bold makeup were the order of the day, and curly hair was no exception.</p><h2>How to Get Curly Hair in the 80s</h2><p>If you wanted to join in on the curly hair trend in the 80s, there were a few different ways to achieve the look. One popular method was to use a perm, which involved applying chemicals to the hair to create permanent curls. Another option was to use hot rollers or a curling iron to create temporary curls that would last until the next wash.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide to Achieving the 80s Curly Hair Look</h2><p>1. Start with clean, dry hair.</p><p>2. Divide your hair into sections.</p><p>3. Apply a styling product, such as mousse or gel, to each section.</p><p>4. Use a curling iron or hot rollers to create curls. Make sure to curl each section in the same direction for a uniform look.</p><p>5. Once all your hair is curled, use a hairspray to keep the curls in place.</p><p>6. Fluff your curls to create volume.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Curly Hair in the 80s</h2><p>1. Use a deep conditioning treatment regularly to keep your hair healthy.</p><p>2. Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as this can cause damage.</p><p>3. Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your curls, rather than a brush.</p><p>4. Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase to prevent frizz.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Did everyone really have curly hair in the 80s?</h3><p>A: While curly hair was certainly popular in the 80s, not everyone had it. Straight hair and other styles were also common.</p><h3>Q: Is it possible to achieve the 80s curly hair look today?</h3><p>A: Absolutely! Many people still love the big, voluminous curls of the 80s and recreate the look using modern styling tools and products.</p><h2>How to Take Care of Curly Hair in the 80s</h2><p>1. Use a shampoo and conditioner specifically designed for curly hair.</p><p>2. Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as this can cause damage.</p><p>3. Use a leave-in conditioner to help keep your curls defined and moisturized.</p><p>4. Avoid brushing your hair when it's dry, as this can cause frizz.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>So there you have it: the story behind why everyone had curly hair in the 80s.

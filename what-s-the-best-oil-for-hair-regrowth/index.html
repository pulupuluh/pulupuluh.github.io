Coconut oil contains lauric acid, which helps penetrate the hair shaft and prevent protein loss, resulting in stronger, healthier hair.

Leave the oil in your hair for at least 30 minutes, or overnight for best results, and then wash your hair with a gentle shampoo.</p><p>To maximize the benefits of hair oil, use it regularly.

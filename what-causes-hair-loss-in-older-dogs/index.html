As dogs get older, their bodies undergo changes that can affect their coat, including a decrease in natural oils that keep the skin and hair healthy.</p><p>Additionally, aging dogs may experience hormonal changes that can lead to hair loss. For example, female dogs may experience hair loss after going through menopause, while male dogs may experience hair loss due to changes in testosterone levels.</p><h2 id="diet">Diet</h2><p>A dog's diet plays a crucial role in their overall health, including the health of their coat. If a dog's diet is lacking in essential nutrients, such as protein, vitamins, and minerals, their coat may become dull and thin, leading to hair loss.</p><p>Additionally, some dogs may have food sensitivities or allergies that can cause itching and irritation, leading to excessive scratching and hair loss.</p><h2 id="environment">Environment</h2><p>The environment in which a dog lives can also impact their coat health.

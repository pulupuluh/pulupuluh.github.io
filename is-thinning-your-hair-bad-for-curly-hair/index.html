Look for products that are specifically designed for curly hair and are free of harsh chemicals and sulfates.</p><h3>2. Avoid heat styling</h3><p>Heat styling can damage your hair and make it more prone to breakage. Try to avoid using heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons as much as possible.</p><h3>3. Eat a healthy diet</h3><p>A healthy diet is essential for healthy hair. Make sure you are getting enough vitamins and nutrients, such as vitamin E, iron, and biotin, which are essential for healthy hair growth.</p><h3>4.

Men's hairstyles in the 1960s were no exception, with a variety of looks that reflected the cultural shifts of the era. From the classic crew cut to the iconic mod style, there was a hairstyle for every man in the 1960s.</p><h2>Description of 1960 Hairstyles Men's</h2><p>The 1960s saw a shift away from the conservative hairstyles of the 1950s, as men began experimenting with longer hair and more expressive styles. The classic crew cut remained popular, but was often worn with longer bangs or a slightly longer top. The pompadour, made famous by Elvis Presley, was also a popular style in the early 1960s.</p><p>As the decade progressed, men's hairstyles became even more daring and expressive. The mod style, characterized by a longer, shaggy cut and a fringe that fell over the forehead, became synonymous with the fashion and music of the era. The Beatles famously sported this style, and it quickly became a cultural phenomenon.</p><p>Other popular hairstyles for men in the 1960s included the slicked-back look, which was achieved by using pomade or gel to slick the hair back and create a shiny, polished look. The afro also emerged as a popular style among black men, and was often worn with a pick to create volume and texture.</p><h2>How to Achieve 1960 Hairstyles Men's</h2><p>If you're interested in achieving a 1960s-inspired hairstyle, there are a few key steps you'll need to follow. First, consider the style you want to achieve - do you want a classic crew cut or a more expressive mod cut?

Depending on the style you choose, you may need to grow your hair out for a few weeks or months before your appointment.</p><p>Once you've achieved your desired length, your stylist will use scissors, clippers, and other tools to create the shape and texture of your chosen style. They may also use products like pomade, gel, or hairspray to help set and hold your hair in place.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide for 1960 Hairstyles Men's</h2><p>If you want to achieve a 1960s-inspired hairstyle at home, here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:</p><h3>For Classic Crew Cut:</h3><ol><li>Wash and towel-dry your hair, then comb it into the desired shape.</li><li>Use clippers to trim the sides and back of your head, leaving the top slightly longer.</li><li>Use scissors to trim the top of your hair to the desired length.</li><li>Style with pomade or gel to create a polished, shiny look.</li></ol><h3>For Mod Style:</h3><ol><li>Wash and towel-dry your hair, then comb it into the desired shape.</li><li>Use scissors to trim the sides and back of your head to a shorter length, leaving the top longer.</li><li>Use scissors to create layers and texture throughout the top of your hair.</li><li>Style with a blow dryer and product like mousse or wax to create volume and texture.</li></ol><h2>Tips for 1960 Hairstyles Men's</h2><p>Here are a few tips to keep in mind when creating a 1960s-inspired hairstyle:</p><ul><li>Use high-quality products to create the desired texture and hold.</li><li>Consider your face shape and hair texture when choosing a style.</li><li>Be open to trying new styles and experimenting with different looks.</li><li>Regularly trim and maintain your hair to keep it looking fresh and polished.</li></ul><h2>FAQ for 1960 Hairstyles Men's</h2><h3>What is the most popular hairstyle for men in the 1960s?</h3><p>The mod style, characterized by a longer, shaggy cut and a fringe that fell over the forehead, was one of the most popular hairstyles for men in the 1960s.</p><h3>How do I achieve a 1960s-inspired hairstyle?</h3><p>To achieve a 1960s-inspired hairstyle, you'll need to visit a barber or stylist who is experienced in creating vintage looks.

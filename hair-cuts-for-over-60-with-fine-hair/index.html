For example, if you have a round face, avoid hair cuts that add volume to the sides of your face.</li><li>Think about your lifestyle: Do you have a busy lifestyle that requires low-maintenance hair? If so, choose a hair cut that is easy to style and maintain.</li><li>Consult with a stylist: A professional stylist can recommend hair cuts that suit your hair type, face shape and lifestyle. They can also provide you with valuable tips on how to maintain your hair.</li></ul><h3>Best Hair Cuts for Over 60 with Fine Hair</h3><p>Here are some of the best hair cuts for over 60 with fine hair:</p><ul><li>Layered bob: This haircut adds volume and texture to your hair, making it look fuller.</li><li>Pixie cut: The pixie cut is a classic hairstyle that never goes out of fashion. It is low-maintenance and suits most face shapes.</li><li>Short shag: The short shag is a versatile haircut that can be styled in many different ways.

Today, we are taking a trip down memory lane and exploring the fashion trends of the 60s. From bold prints to mini skirts, the 60s was a decade of experimentation and self-expression. Read on to find out more about what was fashionable in the 60s and how you can incorporate these trends into your wardrobe today.</p><h2>What was fashionable in the 60s?</h2><p>The 60s was a decade of social and political change, and fashion was no exception. The fashion trends of the 60s were influenced by the youth movement, which embraced new styles and rejected traditional gender roles. Here are some of the key fashion trends of the 60s:</p><ul><li><a href="#bold-prints">Bold prints</a></li><li><a href="#mini-skirts">Mini skirts</a></li><li><a href="#go-go-boots">Go-go boots</a></li><li><a href="#bell-bottoms">Bell-bottoms</a></li><li><a href="#turtlenecks">Turtlenecks</a></li></ul><h3 id="bold-prints">Bold Prints</h3><p>One of the defining fashion trends of the 60s was bold prints. From psychedelic patterns to paisley prints, the 60s was all about making a statement with your clothing. To incorporate this trend into your wardrobe today, try pairing a bold printed top with neutral bottoms, or vice versa. You can also experiment with mixing prints for a fun and playful look.</p><h3 id="mini-skirts">Mini Skirts</h3><p>The mini skirt was another iconic fashion trend of the 60s. This short and sassy skirt became a symbol of the youth movement and was worn by women of all ages. To rock the mini skirt trend today, pair a mini skirt with a blouse or sweater and some knee-high boots for a chic and stylish look.</p><h3 id="go-go-boots">Go-go Boots</h3><p>Go-go boots were a staple of 60s fashion. These knee-high boots were typically made of patent leather and were often worn with mini skirts or dresses.

These flared pants were often worn with platform shoes and were a symbol of the hippie movement. To rock the bell-bottom trend today, pair some flared pants with a simple blouse or t-shirt and some chunky heels.</p><h3 id="turtlenecks">Turtlenecks</h3><p>Turtlenecks were a popular fashion item in the 60s. These high-necked sweaters were often worn with mini skirts or high-waisted pants. To incorporate this trend into your wardrobe today, try pairing a turtleneck with some wide-leg pants or a midi skirt for a chic and sophisticated look.</p><h2>How to Incorporate 60s Fashion into Your Wardrobe Today</h2><p>If you're looking to incorporate some 60s fashion into your wardrobe today, there are a few key tips to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Start with one statement piece and build your outfit around it.</li><li>Experiment with mixing prints and patterns.</li><li>Don't be afraid to play with color.</li><li>Accessorize with bold jewelry and statement bags.</li></ul><h2>Step by Step Guide to Creating a 60s-Inspired Outfit</h2><p>If you're ready to create a 60s-inspired outfit, here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:</p><ol><li>Choose a bold printed top or bottom.</li><li>Pair it with a neutral counterpart (e.g. if you're wearing a bold printed top, pair it with neutral pants or a skirt).</li><li>Add some statement accessories, such as chunky jewelry or a statement bag.</li><li>Finish off the look with some bold makeup and a chic hairstyle.</li></ol><h2>Tips for Maintaining a 60s Hairstyle</h2><p>If you're looking to incorporate some 60s hairstyles into your look, here are a few tips for maintaining your hair:</p><ul><li>Invest in a good quality hairspray to keep your hair in place.</li><li>Use a teasing comb to add volume to your hair.</li><li>Consider investing in a wig or hair extensions for a more authentic look.</li><li>Experiment with different hair accessories, such as headbands or scarves.</li></ul><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>What was the most popular fashion trend of the 60s?</h3><p>One of the most popular fashion trends of the 60s was the mini skirt.</p><h3>What were some popular colors in 60s fashion?</h3><p>Some popular colors in 60s fashion included bright, bold hues like orange, pink, and yellow.</p><h3>What were some popular hairstyles in the 60s?</h3><p>Some popular hairstyles in the 60s included the beehive, the bouffant, and long, straight hair.</p><h3>What accessories were popular in 60s fashion?</h3><p>Some popular accessories in 60s fashion included chunky jewelry, headbands, and scarves.</p><h3>Can I wear 60s fashion trends today?</h3><p>Absolutely! 60s fashion trends are still popular today and can be easily incorporated into your wardrobe.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>And there you have it – a guide to what was fashionable in the 60s.

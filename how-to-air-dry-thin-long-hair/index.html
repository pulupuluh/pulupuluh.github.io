Avoid applying too much product, as this can weigh down your hair.</li><li>Part your hair down the middle and divide it into two sections. Twist each section and clip it up to allow air to circulate and dry your hair evenly.</li><li>Let your hair air dry for at least 30 minutes. If you have more time, you can let it dry for longer.</li><li>Remove the clips and gently shake out your hair.

Avoid rubbing your hair with a towel, as this can cause breakage and frizz.</li><li>Apply a leave-in conditioner or hair oil to protect your hair from damage and add moisture. Use a dime-sized amount for thin long hair, and work it through your hair from mid-length to the ends.</li><li>Part your hair down the middle and divide it into two sections.

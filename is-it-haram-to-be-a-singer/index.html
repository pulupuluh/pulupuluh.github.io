There is no clear-cut answer to this question, as it depends on various factors such as the type of music being sung and the context in which it is performed. In this article, we will explore the different perspectives on singing in Islam and provide some guidance for aspiring singers.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>What does Islam say about singing?</h3><p>There is no explicit prohibition on singing in Islam, but some scholars believe that certain types of music and lyrics are haram. For example, music that promotes immorality, violence, or idolatry is considered haram by some. However, many Muslims enjoy listening to and performing music that is uplifting, spiritual, and culturally significant.</p><h3>Is it haram to perform in front of a mixed audience?</h3><p>Some scholars believe that it is haram to perform in front of a mixed audience, as it may lead to fitnah (temptation) and undermine the modesty of both performers and audience members. However, others argue that as long as the music is halal and the performers maintain their dignity and respect, it is permissible to perform in front of a mixed audience.</p><h3>Can women sing in public?</h3><p>There is some disagreement among scholars about whether women can sing in public. Some argue that it is haram for women to sing in front of men who are not their mahram (close male relatives), while others believe that women can sing in public as long as they dress modestly and maintain their dignity.</p><h2 id="howto">How to Become a Singer?</h2><p>If you are interested in pursuing a career as a singer, there are several steps you can take:</p><h3>1.

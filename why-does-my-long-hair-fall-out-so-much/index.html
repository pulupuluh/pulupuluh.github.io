Here are some steps you can take to determine what might be causing your hair loss:</p><h3>Step 1: Consult with a Doctor</h3><p>If you are losing an excessive amount of hair, it is important to talk to a doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Your doctor may perform blood tests or other diagnostic tests to determine if there are any hormonal imbalances or nutritional deficiencies that could be causing your hair loss.</p><h3>Step 2: Evaluate your Hair Care Routine</h3><p>Your hair care routine could also be contributing to your hair loss.

Instead, opt for looser hairstyles that do not pull on your hair.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help prevent hair loss:</p><ul><li>Avoid using hot tools, such as curling irons and straighteners, too frequently</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it is wet, as it is more vulnerable to damage when wet</li><li>Avoid using hair ties with metal clasps, as they can damage your hair</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun by wearing a hat or using a UV protectant spray</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Can stress cause hair loss?</h3><p>A: Yes, stress can cause hair loss.

The male fashion and grooming subreddits are great places to find inspiration for your new hairstyle.

Determine your hair type by considering its thickness, texture, and natural curl. The following hair types are common:</p><ul><li>Straight</li><li>Wavy</li><li>Curly</li><li>Thick</li><li>Thin</li></ul><h3>Step 3: Browse male hair subreddits</h3><p>Browse male hair subreddits such as r/malehairadvice, r/malefashionadvice, and r/malegrooming to find inspiration and advice from other males. Look for hairstyles that suit your face shape and hair type.</p><h3>Step 4: Save hairstyle inspiration</h3><p>Save hairstyle inspiration to your Reddit account or take screenshots to show your hairstylist. Make sure to save multiple options to give your hairstylist a variety of styles to work with.</p><h3>Step 5: Consult with a hairstylist</h3><p>Consult with a hairstylist to determine which hairstyle will suit you best.

The short answer is no, they don't shave your eyebrows. In this article, we'll explain why and give you some tips on how to prepare for your microblading appointment.</p><h2>Why Don't They Shave Your Eyebrows?</h2><p>The reason they don't shave your eyebrows before microblading is that the technician needs to see your natural brow shape to create the most natural-looking result. If your brows are shaved, they can't see the direction of your hair growth or the way your natural hairs lay. This can lead to an unnatural-looking result.</p><p>Instead of shaving your eyebrows, the technician will simply clean them and shape them using tweezers or wax. This will help to create a clean, defined shape that will complement your face shape.</p><h2>How to Prepare for Your Microblading Appointment</h2><p>Before your microblading appointment, there are a few things you can do to prepare:</p><h3>1. Avoid Blood Thinners</h3><p>Two weeks before your appointment, avoid taking blood thinners such as aspirin or ibuprofen. This will help to prevent excess bleeding during the procedure.</p><h3>2. Avoid Alcohol and Caffeine</h3><p>24 hours before your appointment, avoid alcohol and caffeine. These substances can cause your skin to be more sensitive, which can make the procedure more uncomfortable than it needs to be.</p><h3>3. Avoid Sun Exposure</h3><p>Avoid sun exposure for at least a week before your appointment. Sunburned or tanned skin can be more sensitive and may not hold the pigment as well as un-tanned skin.</p><h3>4. Avoid Waxing or Tweezing</h3><p>Avoid waxing or tweezing your eyebrows for at least a week before your appointment. This will allow your technician to see the natural shape of your brows and create the best result.</p><h2>The Microblading Procedure</h2><p>During the microblading procedure, the technician will use a small handheld tool to create small, hair-like strokes in the skin beneath your eyebrow. They will use a pigment that matches your natural hair color to create a natural-looking result.</p><p>The procedure can take anywhere from 1-3 hours, depending on the amount of brow coverage you want. You may experience some discomfort during the procedure, but the technician will apply a numbing cream to help minimize any pain.</p><h2>Aftercare Tips</h2><p>After your microblading appointment, it's important to follow these tips:</p><h3>1. Avoid Getting Your Brows Wet</h3><p>Avoid getting your brows wet for at least 7-10 days after the procedure. This includes avoiding swimming, sweating, and washing your face near your eyebrows.</p><h3>2. Avoid Sun Exposure</h3><p>Avoid sun exposure for at least a week after your appointment. Sunburned or tanned skin can cause the pigment to fade faster.</p><h3>3. Avoid Touching Your Brows</h3><p>Avoid touching your brows for at least a week after the procedure. This can cause the pigment to smear or become infected.</p><h3>4. Use Healing Ointment</h3><p>Your technician will provide you with a healing ointment to apply to your brows. Use this as directed to help speed up the healing process.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: How Long Does Microblading Last?</h3><p>A: Microblading can last anywhere from 1-3 years, depending on your skin type and how well you take care of your brows.</p><h3>Q: Is Microblading Painful?</h3><p>A: There may be some discomfort during the procedure, but most technicians will apply a numbing cream to help minimize any pain.</p><h3>Q: Can I Wear Makeup After Microblading?</h3><p>A: You should avoid wearing makeup near your eyebrows for at least a week after the procedure. This will allow your brows to heal properly.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>If you're considering microblading, it's important to take good care of your hair in the weeks leading up to your appointment. This will help to ensure that your brows hold the pigment well and look their best.</p><p>Some tips for hair care include:</p><h3>1. Avoid Using Harsh Chemicals</h3><p>Avoid using harsh chemicals on your hair, such as bleach or hair dye, for at least a week before your appointment. These chemicals can make your skin more sensitive and may cause the pigment to fade faster.</p><h3>2. Keep Your Hair Clean</h3><p>Make sure to keep your hair clean in the days leading up to your appointment. This will help to prevent excess oil from getting on your brows and interfering with the pigment.</p><h3>3. Avoid Using Hair Products Near Your Brows</h3><p>Avoid using hair products near your brows, such as hairspray or gel. These products can cause the pigment to smear or become infected.</p><p>By following these tips, you can help to ensure that your microblading appointment goes smoothly and that your brows look their best.</p></article>

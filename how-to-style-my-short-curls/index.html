Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair with products that are specifically formulated for curly hair.

Hold the diffuser close to your scalp and move it around your head, scrunching your hair with your fingers as you go.</p><h3>5. Finish with Hair Spray</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, finish with a light mist of hairspray to hold your curls in place throughout the day.

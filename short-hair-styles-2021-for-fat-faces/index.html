But don't worry, we've got you covered! In this article, we'll be discussing the top short hair styles for fat faces in 2021. From how to style your hair to tips on maintaining it, read on to learn everything you need to know.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Short hair styles are perfect for those with round or fat faces as they help to create an illusion of length and slimness. Choosing the right style can make a significant difference in your overall appearance. In 2021, there are many options available for those with fat faces, so you are sure to find something that suits your taste and style.</p><h2>How to Choose the Right Short Hair Style for Your Fat Face</h2><p>Before choosing a short hair style, it's important to consider your face shape and hair texture. Here are some tips to help you choose the right style for your fat face:</p><h3>Consider Your Face Shape</h3><p>For those with round or fat faces, it's best to choose a hairstyle that adds length and height to your face. A layered cut or a bob with layers can help to create a slimming effect. Avoid hairstyles that add volume to the sides of your face, such as blunt bangs or a bob that ends at your chin.</p><h3>Think About Your Hair Texture</h3><p>If you have fine hair, a layered cut can help to add volume and texture to your hair, making it appear thicker. If you have thick hair, a shorter cut can help to make your hair more manageable and easier to style.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide to Styling Short Hair for Fat Faces</h2><p>Once you have chosen the right short hair style, it's important to know how to style it correctly. Here is a step by step guide to styling short hair for fat faces:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair with products that are suitable for your hair type. Use a towel to gently dry your hair, being careful not to rub it too hard.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Styling Products</h3><p>Apply a small amount of styling product to your hair, such as mousse or gel. Use your fingers to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Blow Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Use a blow dryer to dry your hair, using a round brush to add volume and shape to your hair. Blow dry your hair in the direction you want it to fall.</p><h3>Step 4: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, use a flat iron or curling iron to style your hair as desired. Finish off with a hairspray to hold your style in place.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Short Hair Style</h2><p>Maintaining your short hair style is essential to keep it looking its best. Here are some tips to help you keep your hair looking great:</p><h3>Visit Your Hairdresser Regularly</h3><p>Regular visits to your hairdresser can help to keep your hair looking healthy and in shape. Your hairdresser can also provide advice on how to maintain your hair at home.</p><h3>Use the Right Hair Products</h3><p>Using the right hair products can help to keep your hair looking healthy and shiny. Choose products that are suitable for your hair type and avoid using too much product, as this can weigh your hair down.</p><h3>Avoid Overstyling Your Hair</h3><p>Overstyling your hair can cause damage and make it more difficult to maintain. Avoid using heat styling tools too often and allow your hair to air dry whenever possible.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Q: Can I wear a pixie cut if I have a fat face?</h3><p>A: Yes, a pixie cut can look great on those with fat faces. However, it's important to choose a style that adds height to your face and avoids adding volume to the sides of your face.</p><h3>Q: How do I know which short hair style is right for me?</h3><p>A: Consider your face shape and hair texture when choosing a short hair style. It's also a good idea to consult with your hairdresser, who can provide advice on which style will suit you best.</p><h3>Q: How often should I wash my short hair?</h3><p>A: How often you wash your hair depends on your hair type and personal preference. However, it's generally recommended to wash your hair every 2-3 days to keep it looking its best.</p><h2>Hair Care Tips for Short Hair Styles</h2><p>Short hair styles require different care than longer hair. Here are some tips to help you keep your short hair looking healthy:</p><h3>Use a Gentle Shampoo</h3><p>Choose a gentle shampoo that is suitable for your hair type to avoid stripping your hair of its natural oils.</p><h3>Avoid Heat Styling Tools</h3><p>Using heat styling tools too often can cause damage to your hair. Try to limit your use of these tools and allow your hair to air dry whenever possible.</p><h3>Protect Your Hair from the Sun</h3><p>Wear a hat or use a hair product that contains SPF to protect your hair from the sun's harmful rays.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Short hair styles are a great option for those with fat faces, as they can help to create a slimming effect. By choosing the right style and following the tips in this article, you can keep your short hair looking healthy and stylish. So go ahead, try out a new short hair style and enjoy the confidence it brings!</p></article>

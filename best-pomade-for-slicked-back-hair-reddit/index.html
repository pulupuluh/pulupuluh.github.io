Make sure to comb it evenly so that there are no bumps or lumps.</p><h3>Step 4: Finish with hairspray</h3><p>Once you've achieved the perfect slicked back look, finish it off with a light mist of hairspray to hold it in place.</p><h2>Top Picks for the Best Pomade for Slicked Back Hair Reddit</h2><p>Now that you know how to achieve the perfect slicked back look, let's dive into our top picks for the best pomade for slicked back hair reddit:</p><h3>1.

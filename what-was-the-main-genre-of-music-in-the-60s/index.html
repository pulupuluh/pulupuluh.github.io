The 60s was a time of great change and innovation, and the music of the era was no exception. From rock and roll to soul, there was something for everyone in this decade. In this post, we’ll take a closer look at the main genre of music in the 60s and why it was so popular.</p><h2>What Was the Main Genre of Music in the 60s?</h2><p>The main genre of music in the 60s was rock and roll. This was a time when many young people were rebelling against the establishment and looking for a new form of expression. Rock and roll was the perfect outlet for this rebellion, as it was loud, energetic, and often featured lyrics that were critical of society.</p><p>Rock and roll was also heavily influenced by the blues, which had been popular in the 50s. Many rock and roll songs featured a bluesy guitar riff or a soulful vocal performance. This fusion of different genres helped to create a sound that was unique to the era.</p><h3>Why Was Rock and Roll So Popular?</h3><p>There are many reasons why rock and roll was so popular in the 60s. For one, it was a form of rebellion against the establishment. Many young people were tired of the conformity of the 50s and were looking for something new and exciting. Rock and roll provided that outlet.</p><p>Another reason why rock and roll was so popular was that it was fun. The music was upbeat and energetic, and it was perfect for dancing. Many people would go to concerts or dance parties just to let loose and have a good time.</p><h3>Other Genres of Music in the 60s</h3><p>While rock and roll was the main genre of music in the 60s, there were other genres that were also popular. Soul music, for example, was a type of music that originated in the African American community and was characterized by its powerful vocals and gospel-influenced sound. Motown was also a popular genre in the 60s, which featured catchy melodies and tight vocal harmonies.</p><p>Folk music was another genre that gained popularity in the 60s. This music was often associated with the protest movement and featured lyrics that were critical of society. Bob Dylan was one of the most famous folk musicians of the era.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>In conclusion, the main genre of music in the 60s was rock and roll. This genre was popular because it provided an outlet for rebellion and was fun to listen to and dance to. While rock and roll was the most popular genre, there were other genres such as soul, Motown, and folk that were also popular. The music of the 60s was truly groundbreaking and continues to influence music to this day.</p></article>

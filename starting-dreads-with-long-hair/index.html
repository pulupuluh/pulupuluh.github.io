You’re about to embark on an exciting, transformative journey that will change the way you see yourself and your hair. However, starting dreads with long hair can be a bit more challenging than starting with short hair. But don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. In this article, we’ll take you through the entire process of starting dreads with long hair, from preparation to maintenance.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Starting dreads with long hair requires a bit of preparation, patience, and dedication. Long hair is more prone to tangling, so you need to make sure that your hair is in its best condition before you start the locking process. In this article, we’ll discuss the different methods of starting dreads with long hair, the tools you need, and the aftercare process.</p><h2>How to Start Dreads with Long Hair</h2><h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Hair</h3><p>The first step in starting dreads with long hair is to prepare your hair for the locking process. This involves washing your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove any product buildup and dirt. It’s important to make sure that your hair is completely clean and free from any oils or conditioners. You can also use a deep conditioning treatment to moisturize your hair, as dry hair can be more prone to breakage.</p><h3>Step 2: Choose Your Method</h3><p>There are several methods of starting dreads with long hair, including the backcombing method, the twisting method, and the crochet method. Each method has its pros and cons, and it’s important to choose a method that suits your hair type and lifestyle. The backcombing method involves teasing your hair to create knots, while the twisting method involves twisting sections of your hair to create locks. The crochet method involves using a small hook to pull your hair through itself to create knots.</p><h3>Step 3: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Once you’ve chosen your method, it’s time to section your hair. This involves dividing your hair into small, equal sections using a comb. The size of the sections will depend on the thickness of your hair and the method you’ve chosen. It’s important to make sure that each section is uniform in size to create a neat, uniform look.</p><h3>Step 4: Start Locking Your Hair</h3><p>Now it’s time to start locking your hair. Depending on the method you’ve chosen, you’ll either be backcombing, twisting, or crocheting your hair to create knots. It’s important to be gentle with your hair and not to pull too tightly, as this can cause breakage. Take your time and work methodically through each section of hair.</p><h3>Step 5: Maintenance</h3><p>Once you’ve created your dreadlocks, it’s important to maintain them properly to keep them looking neat and healthy. This involves washing your hair regularly with a residue-free shampoo, using a dreadlock-specific conditioner to keep your hair moisturized, and retwisting or palm-rolling your hair to maintain the shape of your dreads.</p><h2>Tips for Starting Dreads with Long Hair</h2><p>Starting dreads with long hair can be a bit more challenging than starting with short hair, but with these tips, you can make the process easier:</p><ul><li>Be patient – the locking process can take several months, so don’t expect immediate results</li><li>Use a residue-free shampoo to avoid buildup</li><li>Be gentle with your hair to avoid breakage</li><li>Use a hair tie to keep your sections in place while you work on them</li><li>Consider getting a professional to help you with the locking process</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Can I start my dreadlocks with extensions?</h3><p>Yes, you can start your dreadlocks with extensions if you don’t have enough natural hair to work with. This is called the “instant locs” method, and it involves attaching synthetic or human hair extensions to your existing hair to create the appearance of dreadlocks.</p><h3>Do I need to cut my hair before starting dreads?</h3><p>No, you don’t need to cut your hair before starting dreads. In fact, starting with long hair can give you more styling options and a fuller, more voluminous look.</p><h3>Can I wash my hair with regular shampoo?</h3><p>No, it’s not recommended to use regular shampoo on your dreadlocks, as it can leave residue and buildup that can be difficult to remove. Instead, use a residue-free shampoo specifically designed for dreadlocks.</p><h2>Hair Care for Dreadlocks</h2><p>Maintaining your dreadlocks is just as important as starting them. Here are some tips for caring for your dreadlocks:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly with a residue-free shampoo</li><li>Avoid using heavy oils or conditioners that can weigh your hair down</li><li>Retwist or palm-roll your hair regularly to maintain the shape of your dreads</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools on your hair, as this can cause damage</li><li>Get regular trims to remove any split ends</li></ul><p>Starting dreads with long hair can be a bit more challenging than starting with short hair, but with patience and dedication, you can achieve the look you want. Whether you choose the backcombing method, the twisting method, or the crochet method, make sure to take care of your hair properly to keep your dreadlocks looking healthy and vibrant.</p></article>

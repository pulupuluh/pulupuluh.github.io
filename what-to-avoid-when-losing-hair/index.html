Instead, opt for looser styles that don't put as much stress on the hair.</p><h2 id="avoid-heat-styling-tools">Avoid Heat Styling Tools</h2><p>Heat styling tools like flat irons, curling irons, and hair dryers can damage hair and cause breakage. If you must use these tools, make sure to use a heat protectant spray and don't use them on high heat. Also, try to limit your use of heat styling tools to once or twice a week.</p><h2 id="avoid-chemical-treatments">Avoid Chemical Treatments</h2><p>Chemical treatments like perms, relaxers, and hair dyes can damage hair and cause breakage. If you must use these treatments, make sure to follow the instructions carefully and don't leave them on for longer than recommended. It's also important to get these treatments done by a professional who knows how to minimize damage.</p><h2 id="avoid-pulling-hair">Avoid Pulling Your Hair</h2><p>Constantly pulling on your hair can cause damage and lead to hair loss.

Look for gentle products that are free of sulfates and parabens.</p><h2 id="avoid-tight-hats">Avoid Tight Hats</h2><p>Tight hats can cause hair loss by pulling on the hair follicles. If you must wear a hat, make sure it's loose and doesn't put too much pressure on the hair.</p><h2 id="avoid-medication-side-effects">Avoid Medication Side Effects</h2><p>Some medications can cause hair loss as a side effect. If you're experiencing hair loss and are taking medication, talk to your doctor about alternative options.</p><h2>Tips for Promoting Hair Growth</h2><p>Along with avoiding the things listed above, there are also things you can do to promote hair growth.

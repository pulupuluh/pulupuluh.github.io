Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Look for Hair with a Tight Curl Pattern</h3><p>Curly hair with a tight curl pattern tends to have more volume than hair with looser curls. Look for hair that has a defined S-shaped curl pattern.</p><h3>2. Choose Hair with a Coarser Texture</h3><p>Hair with a coarser texture tends to be thicker and fuller, which can add volume to your curls. Look for hair that is labeled as "coarse" or "thick."</p><h3>3. Avoid Hair with a Silky Texture</h3><p>Hair that is too silky or smooth can be difficult to style and may not hold curls well. Look for hair that has a slightly rough texture, which will help your curls hold their shape.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Now that you know how to choose the right type of curly hair, it's time to style your curls for maximum volume. Here's how:</p><h3>1. Start with Clean, Detangled Hair</h3><p>Wash and condition your hair using products that are designed for curly hair.

This will help to enhance your curls and add volume.</p><h3>5. Scrunch Your Hair</h3><p>While your hair is still damp, use your hands to scrunch your curls upward. This will help to enhance the curl pattern and add volume.</p><h3>6. Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Finish off your look with a light mist of hairspray. This will help to hold your curls in place and add some extra volume.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Adding Volume to Curly Hair</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for adding volume to your curly hair:</p><h3>1.

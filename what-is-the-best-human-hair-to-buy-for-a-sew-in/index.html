This hairstyle is a great way to add length, volume, and texture to your hair without damaging your natural hair. There are many different types of human hair available for sew ins, including Brazilian, Peruvian, Indian, and Malaysian hair. Each type of hair has its own unique characteristics, so it's important to choose the best one for your needs. </p><h2 id="how-to">How to Choose the Best Human Hair for a Sew In</h2><p>When choosing human hair for your sew in, there are several factors to consider:</p><h3>1. Quality</h3><p>The quality of the human hair you buy is one of the most important factors to consider. High-quality human hair will look and feel more natural, and will last longer than lower-quality hair. Look for hair that is soft, smooth, and shiny, with minimal shedding and tangling.</p><h3>2. Texture</h3><p>The texture of the human hair you choose should match your natural hair texture as closely as possible. If you have straight hair, choose straight human hair. If you have curly or wavy hair, choose curly or wavy human hair. This will help your sew in blend in seamlessly with your natural hair.</p><h3>3. Length and Color</h3><p>Choose the length and color of your human hair based on your personal preferences and the look you're going for. Keep in mind that longer hair will require more maintenance, and that darker colors will show less damage over time.</p><h3>4. Price</h3><p>The price of human hair can vary widely depending on the quality, texture, length, and color. While it may be tempting to choose the cheapest option available, investing in high-quality human hair will save you money in the long run by lasting longer and looking better.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide to Sewing in Human Hair</h2><p>Here's a step by step guide to sewing in human hair:</p><h3>1. Prepare Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your natural hair, and then blow dry it straight. Create small braids all over your head, starting at the back and working your way up to the front.</p><h3>2. Prepare Your Human Hair</h3><p>Measure and cut the human hair to the desired length, and then wash and condition it. Allow the hair to air dry or blow dry it on a low setting.</p><h3>3. Sew in the Human Hair</h3><p>Using a curved needle and thread, sew the human hair onto the braids in a circular pattern, starting at the back and working your way up to the front. Be sure to sew the hair close to the scalp to create a natural look.</p><h3>4. Style Your Hair</h3><p>Once the human hair is sewn in, style it as desired using hot tools or hair products. </p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Your Sew In</h2><p>To keep your sew in looking its best, follow these tips:</p><h3>1. Wash and Condition Regularly</h3><p>Wash and condition your sew in at least once a week to keep it clean and healthy.</p><h3>2. Use Heat Protection</h3><p>If you use hot tools on your sew in, be sure to use a heat protectant to prevent damage.</p><h3>3. Don't Scratch Your Scalp</h3><p>Avoid scratching your scalp to prevent pulling on the sew in and causing damage.</p><h3>4. Sleep with a Silk or Satin Bonnet</h3><p>Wear a silk or satin bonnet to bed to protect your sew in and prevent tangling.</p><h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>What is the best type of human hair for a sew in?</h3><p>The best type of human hair for a sew in depends on your personal preferences and hair type. Brazilian, Peruvian, Indian, and Malaysian hair are all popular options.</p><h3>How long does a sew in last?</h3><p>A sew in can last anywhere from 4 to 12 weeks, depending on how well it's maintained.</p><h3>Can I wash my sew in?</h3><p>Yes, you can wash your sew in. In fact, it's important to wash it regularly to keep it clean and healthy.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Your Sew In</h2><p>Here are some additional hair care tips for your sew in:</p><h3>1. Moisturize</h3><p>Use a moisturizing spray or oil on your sew in to keep it hydrated and healthy.</p><h3>2. Trim Regularly</h3><p>Trim the ends of your sew in regularly to prevent split ends and maintain its shape.</p><h3>3. Avoid Swimming</h3><p>Avoid swimming or getting your sew in wet, as this can cause damage and tangling.</p><p>Overall, choosing the best human hair for your sew in requires careful consideration of your personal preferences and hair type.

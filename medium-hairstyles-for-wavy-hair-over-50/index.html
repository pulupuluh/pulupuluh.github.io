These hairstyles are also ideal for women who want to keep their hair length but still want to add volume, texture, and movement to their hair.</p><p>Medium hairstyles for wavy hair over 50 can range from shoulder-length bobs, layered cuts, shaggy styles, and tousled waves. These hairstyles are perfect for women who have fine, thick, or curly hair and can be styled in many different ways to suit your personal style and preferences.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Choose the Right Medium Hairstyle for Wavy Hair over 50</h2><p>Choosing the right medium hairstyle for wavy hair over 50 can be a challenge, but with these tips, you can find the perfect hairstyle that flatters your features and enhances your beauty:</p><h3>Consider Your Face Shape</h3><p>When choosing a medium hairstyle, it’s essential to consider your face shape. For example, if you have a round face, a layered cut with long side-swept bangs can help elongate your face and create a slimming effect. On the other hand, if you have an oval face, you can try a shoulder-length bob with blunt ends to accentuate your cheekbones and jawline.</p><h3>Think about Your Hair Texture</h3><p>Your hair texture is also an important factor when choosing a medium hairstyle. If you have fine hair, you can opt for layers to add volume and texture to your hair. On the other hand, if you have thick hair, you can try a blunt cut to add weight to your hair and create a sleek look.</p><h3>Consider Your Lifestyle</h3><p>When choosing a medium hairstyle for wavy hair over 50, it’s important to consider your lifestyle. If you have a busy schedule and don’t have time to style your hair every day, you can try a low-maintenance hairstyle like a messy bob or tousled waves. On the other hand, if you have more time to style your hair, you can try a sleek and polished look like a straight bob or layered cut.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide to Styling Medium Hairstyles for Wavy Hair over 50</h2><p>Styling medium hairstyles for wavy hair over 50 doesn’t have to be complicated.

Hold each section for a few seconds before releasing the curl.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Finish by spraying your hair with a light-hold hairspray to keep your curls in place.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips to Keep Your Medium Hairstyle for Wavy Hair over 50 Looking Great</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you maintain your medium hairstyle for wavy hair over 50:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and hydrated.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair to prevent heat damage.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to maintain the shape and length of your hairstyle.</li><li>Use a hair mask once a week to nourish and hydrate your hair.</li><li>Avoid using too many styling products on your hair to prevent buildup and damage.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>What are the best medium hairstyles for wavy hair over 50?</h3><p>The best medium hairstyles for wavy hair over 50 are shoulder-length bobs, layered cuts, shaggy styles, and tousled waves.</p><h3>How do I style medium hairstyles for wavy hair over 50?</h3><p>You can style medium hairstyles for wavy hair over 50 by washing and conditioning your hair, applying a heat protectant, blow-drying your hair, curling your hair, and finishing with hairspray.</p><h3>How do I maintain my medium hairstyle for wavy hair over 50?</h3><p>You can maintain your medium hairstyle for wavy hair over 50 by using a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner, avoiding too much heat, trimming your hair regularly, using a hair mask once a week, and avoiding too many styling products.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Medium Hairstyles for Wavy Hair over 50</h2><p>Here are some hair care tips to keep your medium hairstyle for wavy hair over 50 looking healthy and beautiful:</p><ul><li>Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair gently.</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it’s wet to prevent breakage.</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun by wearing a hat or using a UV protection spray.</li></ul><p>With these tips and tricks, you can find the perfect medium hairstyle for wavy hair over 50 that flatters your features, enhances your beauty, and makes you look younger.

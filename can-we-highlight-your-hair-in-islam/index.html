As for hair highlighting, there is no clear-cut answer as to whether it is permissible or not, as it depends on several factors. </p><p> According to some scholars, highlighting hair is permissible as long as it is done in moderation and does not involve any haram (prohibited) substances or methods. However, others argue that it is not allowed because it goes against the principle of modesty and draws unnecessary attention to oneself. </p><h2> How to Highlight Your Hair in Islam </h2><p> If you decide to highlight your hair, it is essential to do so in a way that is in line with Islamic guidelines. Here are some tips to follow: </p><h3> Choose Natural Colors </h3><p> It is best to choose natural colors such as brown, blonde, or red, as they are closer to the natural hair color and look more subtle. Avoid bright or neon colors that are attention-grabbing and go against the principle of modesty. </p><h3> Use Halal Products </h3><p> Make sure to use halal products that do not contain any haram substances such as alcohol or animal-derived ingredients. You can check the ingredients list before purchasing any hair dye or highlighting product. </p><h3> Avoid Excessive Highlighting </h3><p> Do not highlight your hair excessively or in a way that looks unnatural. Stick to a few subtle highlights that blend in with your natural hair color and enhance your beauty without drawing too much attention. </p><h2> Step-by-Step Guide to Highlight Your Hair </h2><p> If you are planning to highlight your hair at home, here is a step-by-step guide to follow: </p><h3> Step 1: Choose the Right Product </h3><p> Choose a highlighting product that is suitable for your hair type and color.

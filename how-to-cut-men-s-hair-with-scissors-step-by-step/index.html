This will make it easier to cut and style. Next, you will need to section the hair using clips or combs. This will help you to work on one section at a time, making it easier to control the length and shape of the hair.</p><p>When cutting men's hair with scissors, it's important to use the right technique. The most common technique is to use the 'scissor over comb' method. This involves using the comb to lift the hair and the scissors to cut it. Another technique is the 'point cutting' method, which involves using the tips of the scissors to create texture and movement in the hair.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><h3>Step 1: Section the Hair</h3><p>Using clips or combs, section the hair into manageable sections. The smaller the sections, the easier it will be to control the length and shape of the hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Start with the Sides</h3><p>Using the 'scissor over comb' method, start cutting the hair on the sides, working your way up towards the top of the head. Remember to cut in small sections, taking your time to ensure that the length and shape are even.</p><h3>Step 3: Move to the Top</h3><p>Once you have finished cutting the sides, move on to the top of the head. Again, using the 'scissor over comb' method, cut the hair in small sections, working your way towards the front of the head.</p><h3>Step 4: Create Texture and Movement</h3><p>If you want to create texture and movement in the hair, use the 'point cutting' method. This involves using the tips of the scissors to cut into the hair, creating a choppy, textured look.</p><h3>Step 5: Blend the Hair</h3><p>Once you have finished cutting the hair, use the scissors to blend the hair together. This will create a more natural, seamless look.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Cutting Men's Hair with Scissors</h2><p>1. Use sharp scissors: Sharp scissors will make it easier to cut the hair and will give you a more precise cut.</p><p>2. Take your time: Cutting men's hair with scissors requires patience and attention to detail. Take your time and don't rush the process.</p><p>3. Use the right technique: The 'scissor over comb' method is the most common technique for cutting men's hair with scissors. However, if you want to create texture and movement, use the 'point cutting' method.</p><p>4. Use the right tools: Along with sharp scissors, you will also need combs and clips to section the hair.</p><h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p><strong>Q: Can I cut my own hair with scissors?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, you can cut your own hair with scissors.

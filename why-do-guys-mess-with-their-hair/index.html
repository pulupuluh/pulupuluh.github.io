From there, we can explore the different reasons behind each behavior.</p><h3>Running Their Hands Through Their Hair</h3><p>One of the most common ways that guys mess with their hair is by running their hands through it. This could be because they are trying to style it or make it look more presentable. It could also be because they enjoy the feeling of their hair between their fingers.</p><h3>Adjusting Their Bangs</h3><p>Another common way that guys mess with their hair is by adjusting their bangs. This could be because they are trying to keep them out of their eyes or because they are self-conscious about the way they look.</p><h3>Twirling Their Hair</h3><p>Finally, some guys might twirl their hair absent-mindedly.

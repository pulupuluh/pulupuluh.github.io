Here are some of the methods you can try:</p><h3>Blow Dryer and Brush</h3><p>Using a round brush and a blow dryer can help straighten your hair. Start by washing and conditioning your hair. Apply a heat protectant spray and divide your hair into sections. Take one section and use the round brush to wrap your hair around it. Blow dry your hair while pulling it downwards with the brush. Repeat with the other sections until your hair is completely dry and straight.</p><h3>Hair Rollers</h3><p>Hair rollers are a great alternative to flat irons. Start by washing your hair and applying a heat protectant spray. Take small sections of your hair and wrap it around the roller. Secure the roller in place and leave it for a few hours or overnight. Remove the rollers and gently comb through your hair to achieve straight hair.</p><h3>Milk and Honey</h3><p>This natural hair straightening method involves using milk and honey. Mix a cup of milk and two tablespoons of honey in a spray bottle. Spray the mixture onto your hair and comb through. Leave it for an hour and then rinse it off with lukewarm water. Your hair will be straighter and softer.</p><h3>Braids</h3><p>Braids are a simple and easy way to straighten your hair. Start by washing and conditioning your hair. Divide your hair into sections and braid each section tightly. Leave the braids overnight or for a few hours.

The good news is that it is possible to get dreads with permed hair! However, it's important to understand the process and the potential challenges that come with it. In this article, we'll go over everything you need to know about getting dreads with permed hair, including how to do it, tips for maintaining your dreads, and more.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Dreadlocks, also known as dreads, are a popular hairstyle that involves twisting and matting hair into ropelike strands. Dreads can be achieved with any hair type, including permed hair. However, permed hair presents some unique challenges when it comes to getting dreads.</p><h2>How to Get Dreads with Permed Hair</h2><p>The process of getting dreads with permed hair is similar to getting dreads with natural hair. Here are the steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Stop Perming Your Hair</h3><p>If you're currently perming your hair, you'll need to stop before you can start the dreadlocking process. Perming your hair weakens it and makes it more prone to breakage, which can make it harder to maintain dreads.</p><h3>Step 2: Wait for Your Hair to Grow Out</h3><p>Once you've stopped perming your hair, you'll need to wait for it to grow out to a length of at least 2-3 inches. This will give you enough hair to work with and make it easier to create and maintain your dreads.</p><h3>Step 3: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Next, you'll need to section your hair into small, even sections. This will make it easier to create and maintain your dreads. You can use clips or rubber bands to keep each section separate.</p><h3>Step 4: Backcomb Your Hair</h3><p>Once your hair is sectioned, you'll need to backcomb each section. Backcombing involves teasing the hair in the opposite direction of its natural growth pattern to create knots and tangles. This process will help your hair mat together and form dreadlocks.</p><h3>Step 5: Maintain Your Dreads</h3><p>Once you've created your dreads, you'll need to maintain them to keep them looking their best. This includes regular washing, conditioning, and retwisting to keep your dreads tight and well-formed.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Dreads with Permed Hair</h2><p>Maintaining dreads with permed hair can be challenging, but it's not impossible. Here are some tips to help you keep your dreads looking great:</p><h3>Tip 1: Use a Gentle Shampoo</h3><p>Permed hair is more fragile than natural hair, so you'll need to use a gentle shampoo to avoid damaging your dreads. Look for a shampoo that's designed for dreadlocks or one that's free of harsh chemicals.</p><h3>Tip 2: Avoid Overwashing</h3><p>Washing your hair too often can cause your dreads to become loose and unravel. Aim to wash your hair once a week or every other week to keep your dreads clean without overwashing.</p><h3>Tip 3: Retwist Your Dreads Regularly</h3><p>Retwisting your dreads every 4-6 weeks will help them stay tight and well-formed. Use a locking gel or wax to help hold your dreads in place as you retwist them.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can You Get Dreads with Relaxed Hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can get dreads with relaxed hair. However, the process is similar to getting dreads with permed hair and presents similar challenges.</p><h3>How Long Does It Take to Get Dreads with Permed Hair?</h3><p>The amount of time it takes to get dreads with permed hair will depend on the length and thickness of your hair. Generally, it can take anywhere from 6 months to a year to fully form mature dreadlocks.</p><h3>Can You Undo Dreads with Permed Hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can undo dreads with permed hair. However, the process can be time-consuming and may require cutting your hair if it's severely matted.</p><h2>Hair Care for Dreads with Permed Hair</h2><p>Maintaining healthy hair is important when you have dreads, especially if you have permed hair. Here are some tips for keeping your hair healthy:</p><h3>Tip 1: Moisturize Regularly</h3><p>Permed hair is more prone to dryness, so it's important to moisturize your hair regularly. Use a leave-in conditioner or oil to keep your hair hydrated.</p><h3>Tip 2: Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Heat styling can damage permed hair and make it more prone to breakage. Avoid using heat-styling tools like flat irons and curling wands, and opt for heat-free styling methods instead.</p><h3>Tip 3: Protect Your Hair at Night</h3><p>Wearing a satin or silk scarf or bonnet at night can help protect your hair and prevent breakage while you sleep.</p><p>Overall, getting dreads with permed hair is possible with the right technique and care. By following the steps and tips outlined in this article, you can achieve healthy, well-formed dreadlocks with permed hair.</p></article>

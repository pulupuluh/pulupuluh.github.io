This popular men's hairstyle involves cutting the hair shorter towards the neck and sides, creating a sharp and clean look. However, it can be tricky to communicate the exact look you want to your barber, especially if you're not familiar with hair terminology. In this blog post, we'll guide you through how to ask for a high taper fade in relaxed English language, so you can walk out of the salon with the perfect haircut!</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A high taper fade typically involves cutting the hair short on the sides and back of the head, gradually blending into longer hair on top. The fade can start high up on the head, just above the ears, or lower down towards the neck. The hair on top can be styled in a variety of ways, such as a slick back, quiff, or messy spikes. The key is to have a noticeable contrast between the length of the hair on top and the shorter sides, creating a sharp and edgy look.</p><h2>How to Ask for a High Taper Fade</h2><p>When you're at the salon or barbershop, it's important to communicate clearly with your hairstylist. Here are some tips on how to ask for a high taper fade:</p><h3>1. Show a picture</h3><p>If you're not sure how to describe the haircut you want, it's always helpful to bring in a picture. You can find examples of high taper fades online or in magazines, and show them to your hairstylist. This will help them understand the look you're going for and make sure you're on the same page.</p><h3>2. Use clear language</h3><p>Even if you don't know the technical terms for haircuts, you can still use clear language to describe what you want. For example, you can say "I want the sides and back of my hair to be short, and gradually get longer towards the top." You can also specify how high you want the fade to start, such as "I want a high fade that starts just above my ears."</p><h3>3. Be open to suggestions</h3><p>Your hairstylist is a trained professional who knows what will look best on you. If they suggest a slightly different variation of the high taper fade, listen to their advice and consider it. They may have insights on how to tailor the haircut to your face shape or hair texture.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how a hairstylist might create a high taper fade:</p><h3>1. Section the hair</h3><p>The hairstylist will section off the hair on top, using clips or hair ties to keep it out of the way.</p><h3>2. Use clippers</h3><p>The hairstylist will use clippers to cut the hair on the sides and back, starting with a longer guard and gradually switching to a shorter one to create the fade effect. They may use a comb or their fingers to blend the hair and create a smooth transition.</p><h3>3. Cut the top</h3><p>The hairstylist will cut the hair on top to the desired length and style it according to your preferences.</p><h3>4. Clean up the edges</h3><p>The hairstylist will use scissors or clippers to clean up any stray hairs around the ears and neckline.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to keep in mind when getting a high taper fade:</p><h3>1. Maintenance</h3><p>A high taper fade requires regular maintenance to keep it looking sharp. You may need to visit the salon every few weeks for touch-ups.</p><h3>2. Product</h3><p>To style your hair on top, you may need to use hair product such as wax, pomade, or gel. Ask your hairstylist for recommendations based on your hair type and desired style.</p><h3>3. Face shape</h3><p>Consider your face shape when choosing the length and style of your hair on top. For example, if you have a round face, you may want to avoid styles that add volume on top.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>1. How long does a high taper fade last?</h3><p>A high taper fade can last anywhere from two to four weeks, depending on how quickly your hair grows and how well you maintain it.</p><h3>2. Can I get a high taper fade with longer hair on top?</h3><p>Yes, you can customize the length of the hair on top to your liking. Just make sure to communicate clearly with your hairstylist.</p><h3>3. Is a high taper fade suitable for all hair types?</h3><p>A high taper fade can work for many hair types, but it may not be suitable for extremely curly or coarse hair. Talk to your hairstylist about whether this haircut is right for you.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>To keep your high taper fade looking fresh and stylish, here are some hair care tips:</p><h3>1. Wash regularly</h3><p>Wash your hair regularly with shampoo and conditioner, to keep it clean and healthy. Avoid using hot water or harsh chemicals that can damage your hair.</p><h3>2. Use product</h3><p>Use hair product to style your hair on top, but be careful not to use too much or it can weigh your hair down. Experiment with different products to find the one that works best for you.</p><h3>3. Protect from sun and heat</h3><p>Avoid exposing your hair to direct sunlight or excessive heat from styling tools, as this can dry out and damage your hair. Use a hat or hair product with SPF if you're going to be outside for a long time.</p><p>With these tips and tricks, you'll be able to confidently ask for a high taper fade and rock this stylish haircut with ease!</p></article>

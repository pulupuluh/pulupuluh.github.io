Avoid rubbing your hair with a towel, as this can cause frizz.</li><li>Apply a curl-enhancing product, such as a curl cream or mousse, to your damp hair. Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair.</li><li>Flip your hair upside down and use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to dry your hair. Start with low heat and low speed, and gradually increase as your hair dries. Scrunch your hair with your hands as you dry it to encourage your curls to form.</li><li>Once your hair is dry, use a curl-defining spray or serum to enhance your curls and reduce frizz.</li><li>Repeat this process every time you wash your hair, gradually training your waves to form into curls.</li></ol><h3 id="tips">Tips and Tricks</h3><p>Here are some additional tips and tricks for training your wavy hair to be curly:</p><ul><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it's dry, as this can cause frizz and disrupt your curl pattern.</li><li>Use a silk or satin pillowcase to reduce friction and prevent frizz while you sleep.</li><li>Avoid touching your hair too much, as this can cause your curls to become limp and flat.</li><li>Consider getting a curly haircut that's tailored to your hair type and curl pattern.</li><li>Experiment with different hair products to find what works best for your hair.</li></ul><h3 id="faq">FAQs</h3><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about training wavy hair to be curly:</p><h4>Can you train wavy hair to be curly?</h4><p>Yes, with the right techniques and products, you can train your wavy hair to be curly.</p><h4>How long does it take to train wavy hair to be curly?</h4><p>The amount of time it takes to train your wavy hair to be curly depends on your hair type and how often you wash and style your hair.

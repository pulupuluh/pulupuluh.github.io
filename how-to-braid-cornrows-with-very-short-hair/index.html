However, many people think that cornrows require long hair to achieve the desired look. This is not true! With the right technique, you can braid cornrows with very short hair. In this article, we will show you how to braid cornrows with very short hair in a relaxed and easy-to-understand language.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Cornrows are a traditional African hairstyle that involves braiding the hair close to the scalp, creating a series of small, raised rows that run from the hairline to the nape of the neck. This hairstyle is popular because it is low maintenance and can last for several weeks. Cornrows can also be styled in many ways, making them a versatile hairstyle for any occasion.</p><h2>How to Braid Cornrows with Very Short Hair</h2><p>If you have very short hair, you may think that cornrows are not possible. However, with the right technique, you can achieve this hairstyle. Here is how:</p><h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Hair</h3><p>Before you begin braiding, you need to prepare your hair. Start by washing your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner. Then, blow-dry your hair or let it air dry. Make sure that your hair is completely dry before you start braiding.</p><h3>Step 2: Divide Your Hair into Sections</h3><p>Divide your hair into small sections. The size of the sections will depend on the length of your hair. If you have very short hair, you may only be able to create one or two sections. Use clips to secure the other sections of your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Create the Cornrows</h3><p>Start at the front of your hairline and take a small section of hair. Divide it into three equal parts. Start braiding your hair by crossing the right section over the middle section, then the left section over the middle section. Keep adding more hair to each section as you braid. Make sure that each section of hair is tight and close to the scalp.</p><p>Continue braiding until you reach the end of the section. Secure the end of the braid with a hair tie or a small rubber band. Repeat this process for each section of hair until you have created the desired number of cornrows.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect cornrows with very short hair:</p><ul><li>Use a rat-tail comb to make sure that each section of hair is even and straight.</li><li>Use hair gel to help hold the hair in place as you braid.</li><li>Practice makes perfect! Don't worry if your first attempt is not perfect. Keep practicing and you will get better.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>How long do cornrows last?</h3><p>Cornrows can last for several weeks with the proper maintenance. However, they may start to look messy after a week or two. You can touch up your cornrows by re-braiding the hair that has come loose.</p><h3>Can I style my cornrows?</h3><p>Yes, you can style your cornrows in many ways. You can add beads, colored hair extensions, or even style them into a bun or ponytail.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>To keep your cornrows looking fresh, you need to take care of your hair. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly with a gentle shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Avoid using heavy oils or products that can clog your pores and cause breakouts.</li><li>Use a silk or satin scarf or pillowcase to protect your hair while you sleep.</li></ul><p>Braiding cornrows with very short hair may seem challenging, but with the right technique and a little practice, it is possible. Follow these steps, tips, and hair care advice to achieve the perfect cornrows with very short hair.</p></article>

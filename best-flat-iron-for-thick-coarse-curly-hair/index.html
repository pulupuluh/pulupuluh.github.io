Look for a flat iron that has adjustable temperature settings so you can choose the right heat for your hair type.</p><h2 id="howto">How to Choose the Best Flat Iron for Thick Coarse Curly Hair</h2><p>When choosing a flat iron for thick coarse curly hair, consider the following factors:</p><h3>Plate Material</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, ceramic or tourmaline plates are ideal for thick coarse curly hair. These materials help to distribute heat evenly and reduce frizz. Titanium plates can also work, but they tend to get hotter than ceramic or tourmaline, so you need to be careful not to damage your hair.</p><h3>Plate Size</h3><p>The wider the plates, the better for thick coarse curly hair. Look for plates that are at least 1.5 inches wide to cover more hair in one pass. This will save you time and minimize heat damage to your hair.</p><h3>Temperature Settings</h3><p>Thick coarse curly hair requires high heat to straighten. However, you don't want to use too much heat as it can damage your hair. Look for a flat iron that has adjustable temperature settings so you can choose the right heat for your hair type. Generally, a temperature range of 350°F to 450°F is ideal for thick coarse curly hair.</p><h2 id="stepbystep">Step-by-Step Guide on How to Use a Flat Iron on Thick Coarse Curly Hair</h2><p>Follow these steps to straighten your thick coarse curly hair using a flat iron:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair with products that are suitable for your hair type. Rinse your hair thoroughly and towel-dry it. Don't use a blow dryer as it can cause more frizz.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Heat Protectant</h3><p>Apply a heat protectant spray or serum to your hair to minimize heat damage. This will also help your hair to stay straight for longer.</p><h3>Step 3: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into manageable parts using clips or hair ties. This will make it easier to straighten your hair and ensure that you cover every strand.</p><h3>Step 4: Turn on Your Flat Iron</h3><p>Turn on your flat iron and set it to the desired temperature. Wait for it to heat up before using it on your hair.</p><h3>Step 5: Straighten Your Hair</h3><p>Starting from the bottom section, take a small part of your hair and place it between the plates of the flat iron. Slowly glide the flat iron down to the ends of your hair. Repeat this process on each section of your hair until you've covered all parts.</p><h3>Step 6: Finish with Hair Serum</h3><p>Finish by applying a hair serum to add shine and reduce frizz. You can also use a hairspray to hold your hair in place.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Using a Flat Iron on Thick Coarse Curly Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your flat iron:</p><ul><li>Always use a heat protectant to minimize heat damage.</li><li>Section your hair into manageable parts to ensure that you cover every strand.</li><li>Don't use too much heat as it can damage your hair.

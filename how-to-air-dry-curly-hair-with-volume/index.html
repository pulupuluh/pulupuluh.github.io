One great way to achieve this look is by air drying your hair. Air drying allows your curls to form naturally, resulting in a more natural and effortless style. However, getting volume with air drying can be tricky. In this article, we'll share some tips and tricks to help you air dry your curly hair with volume.</p><h2>How to Air Dry Curly Hair with Volume: Step by Step</h2><p>Follow these steps to air dry your curly hair with volume:</p><h3>Step 1: Cleanse Your Hair</h3><p>Start with clean hair. Use a sulfate-free shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner to keep your curls healthy and hydrated. Rinse your hair thoroughly with cool water to help seal the cuticles and enhance shine.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Products</h3><p>Apply a leave-in conditioner or curl cream to your hair after washing. This will help to define your curls and keep them hydrated. Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Flip Your Hair</h3><p>Flip your hair upside down and gently scrunch your curls with your hands to encourage volume. You can also use a microfiber towel or an old T-shirt to scrunch your curls and remove excess water.</p><h3>Step 4: Let Your Hair Air Dry</h3><p>Let your hair air dry naturally. Avoid touching your hair too much to prevent frizz. You can also use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your hair on low heat if you're in a rush.</p><h3>Step 5: Fluff Your Curls</h3><p>Once your hair is completely dry, flip your head back up and use your fingers to fluff your curls. This will help to add volume and create a more natural look.

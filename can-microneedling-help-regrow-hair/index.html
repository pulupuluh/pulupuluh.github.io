However, recent studies have shown that microneedling may also be effective for hair restoration.</p><h2>How Does Microneedling Help Regrow Hair?</h2><p>The theory behind microneedling for hair restoration is that the tiny punctures created by the dermaroller stimulate the production of growth factors, which can help promote hair growth.

Roll the dermaroller over your scalp in different directions, being careful not to apply too much pressure.</p><h3>Step 4: Apply Hair Growth Serum</h3><p>After microneedling, apply a hair growth serum to your scalp. This can help nourish your hair follicles and promote hair growth.</p><h3>Step 5: Repeat the Treatment</h3><p>For best results, repeat the microneedling treatment once a week for several weeks.

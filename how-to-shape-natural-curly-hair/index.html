In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of shaping your natural curly hair, step-by-step.

Here are the basic steps:</p><h3>1. Start with clean, wet hair.</h3><p>Wash your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, and gently towel dry your hair so it's damp but not soaking wet.</p><h3>2. Apply a styling product.</h3><p>Choose a styling product that works well with your hair type and texture. If you have fine hair, try a lightweight mousse or gel. If you have thicker hair, a cream or butter might work better. Apply the product evenly throughout your hair, using your fingers or a wide-tooth comb.</p><h3>3. Use a diffuser.</h3><p>Attach a diffuser to your blow dryer and set it to a low heat setting. Gently scrunch your hair with the diffuser, lifting your curls up towards your scalp. This will help to enhance your natural curl pattern and add volume.</p><h3>4. Shape your curls.</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, use your fingers or a pick to gently shape your curls. You can also use a curling iron or wand to define individual curls, if desired. Be gentle and avoid using too much heat, as this can damage your hair over time.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step</h2><p>Here's a more detailed breakdown of the steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash your hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.

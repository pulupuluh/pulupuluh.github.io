But what kind of hair is used for microlink extensions? In this article, we will explore the different types of hair used for microlink extensions, how to choose the right hair for your extensions, and tips for maintaining your extensions once they are installed.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Microlink extensions are a type of hair extension that uses small, silicone-lined beads to attach the hair to your natural hair. The process involves looping the extension hair through the bead and then clamping the bead onto your natural hair. This method allows for a natural look and feel, as well as flexibility in styling. The extensions can last up to several months with proper care.</p><h2>How to Choose the Right Hair</h2><p>When choosing the hair for your microlink extensions, there are a few factors to consider:</p><h3>Texture</h3><p>The texture of the hair should match your natural hair texture as closely as possible. This will ensure that the extensions blend seamlessly with your natural hair. If you have straight hair, choose straight extensions. If you have curly hair, choose curly extensions.</p><h3>Color</h3><p>The color of the extensions should also match your natural hair color. If you have highlights or lowlights, you may want to consider getting multiple shades of extensions to create a more natural look.</p><h3>Length</h3><p>The length of the extensions should be chosen based on your desired look. If you want to add volume, you may only need a few inches of extensions. If you want to add length, you may need several inches of extensions.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Once you have chosen the hair for your microlink extensions, the installation process involves the following steps:</p><h3>1. Wash and dry your hair</h3><p>Your hair should be clean and dry before installation. This will ensure that the extensions adhere properly.</p><h3>2. Section your hair</h3><p>Your natural hair will be sectioned and the extensions will be attached to each section using the beads. The sections will depend on how many extensions you are getting and the desired look.</p><h3>3. Loop the extension hair through the bead</h3><p>The extension hair is looped through the bead and then the bead is clamped onto your natural hair.</p><h3>4. Repeat</h3><p>The process is repeated until all of the desired extensions are attached.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips for maintaining your microlink extensions:</p><h3>1. Use a gentle shampoo</h3><p>Avoid using harsh shampoos that can damage the extensions. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner that is sulfate-free.</p><h3>2. Brush regularly</h3><p>Brush your extensions regularly to prevent tangling and matting. Use a soft-bristled brush and start at the ends and work your way up.</p><h3>3. Avoid heat</h3><p>Avoid using heated styling tools on your extensions, as this can damage the hair. If you must use a heat tool, use a heat protectant spray.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: How long do microlink extensions last?</h3><p>A: Microlink extensions can last up to several months with proper care.</p><h3>Q: Can I color my microlink extensions?</h3><p>A: It is not recommended to color your microlink extensions, as this can damage the hair. If you want a different color, it is best to purchase new extensions.</p><h3>Q: Can I swim with microlink extensions?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can swim with microlink extensions. However, it is recommended to wear a swim cap to protect the extensions from chlorine and salt water.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Proper hair care is essential for maintaining your microlink extensions. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner, brush regularly, and avoid heat tools. If you follow these tips, your extensions will look great for several months.</p></article>

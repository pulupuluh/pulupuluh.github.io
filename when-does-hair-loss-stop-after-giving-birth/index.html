It typically begins around three months after giving birth and can last up to a year. During pregnancy, hormonal changes can cause hair to grow thicker and faster.

This can result in noticeable hair loss, which can be concerning for many new moms.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Deal With Postpartum Hair Loss</h2><p>Postpartum hair loss can be challenging to deal with, but there are several things you can do to minimize its impact on your hair and self-confidence. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Be Gentle with Your Hair</h3><p>When your hair is shedding, it is more fragile than usual. Avoid using hot styling tools and tight hairstyles that pull on your hair. Instead, opt for loose styles that don't require much manipulation.</p><h3>2. Eat a Balanced Diet</h3><p>A balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals can help promote healthy hair growth. Foods that are good for hair include leafy greens, nuts, and fish.</p><h3>3. Take Supplements</h3><p>Supplements like biotin, iron, and vitamin D can help support healthy hair growth.</p><h3>4.

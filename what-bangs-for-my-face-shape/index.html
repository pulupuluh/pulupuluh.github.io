There are six common face shapes: oval, round, square, heart, diamond, and long. Here's how to figure out which one you have:</p><ul><li>Oval: your face is longer than it is wide, and your forehead is slightly wider than your jaw.</li><li>Round: your face is nearly as wide as it is long, and your cheekbones are the widest part of your face.</li><li>Square: your face is as wide as it is long, and your jaw is the most prominent feature.</li><li>Heart: your forehead is wider than your jaw, and your chin comes to a point.</li><li>Diamond: your forehead and jaw are both narrow, and your cheekbones are the widest part of your face.</li><li>Long: your face is longer than it is wide, and your forehead, cheekbones, and jaw are all about the same width.</li></ul><h2 id="bangs-for-each-shape">Bangs Styles for Different Face Shapes</h2><p>Now that you know your face shape, it's time to figure out what bangs will look best on you. Here are some general guidelines:</p><ul><li>Oval: You're lucky - just about any bangs style will look great on you! Consider a blunt cut or long, side-swept bangs.</li><li>Round: Go for long, side-swept bangs that angle down towards the sides of your face. Avoid blunt bangs that cut straight across.</li><li>Square: Soften your angular features with long, wispy bangs that angle slightly to the side.</li><li>Heart: Balance out your face shape with long, side-swept bangs that angle towards the outer corners of your eyes.</li><li>Diamond: Similar to heart-shaped faces, go for long, side-swept bangs that angle towards the outer corners of your eyes.</li><li>Long: Add some width to your face with wispy, curtain bangs that start at your temples and angle towards the outer corners of your eyes.</li></ul><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Cutting Your Own Bangs</h2><p>If you're feeling brave and want to cut your own bangs, here's a step-by-step guide:</p><ol><li>Start with dry, styled hair that's free of tangles.</li><li>Section off the hair you want to cut into a triangle shape, with the point of the triangle at the center of your forehead.</li><li>Use hair cutting shears to cut straight across the triangle, starting at the center and working outwards. Cut less than you think you need - you can always go back and trim more later.</li><li>Use a comb to blend the bangs into the rest of your hair, and make any additional adjustments as needed.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips and Tricks for Maintaining Your Bangs</h2><p>Once you have your bangs, there are a few things you can do to keep them looking great:</p><ul><li>Wash your bangs more frequently than the rest of your hair, as they can get greasy faster.</li><li>Blow dry your bangs with a round brush to give them volume and shape.</li><li>Use dry shampoo to extend the time between washes and keep your bangs looking fresh.</li><li>Invest in a good pair of hair cutting shears if you plan on trimming your own bangs regularly.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs About Bangs for Face Shapes</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about bangs for different face shapes:</p><h3>Can round faces pull off blunt bangs?</h3><p>While it's not impossible, blunt bangs can make round faces look even rounder. Long, side-swept bangs that angle down towards the sides of your face are a better option.</p><h3>What bangs style looks best on heart-shaped faces?</h3><p>Long, side-swept bangs that angle towards the outer corners of your eyes can help balance out a heart-shaped face.</p><h3>Should square faces avoid choppy bangs?</h3><p>Yes - soft, wispy bangs that angle to the side are a better option for square faces.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips for Bangs</h2><p>Lastly, here are some general hair care tips for keeping your bangs looking their best:</p><ul><li>Use a heat protectant spray before blow drying or using hot tools on your bangs.</li><li>Avoid touching your bangs too much throughout the day, as the oils from your fingers can make them greasy.</li><li>If you're struggling to style your bangs, consider using a hair straightener or curling iron to add some texture.</li><li>Trim your bangs regularly to prevent them from getting too long and weighing down your face.</li></ul><p>With these tips and tricks, you're well on your way to finding the perfect bangs for your face shape. Whether you go for long, side-swept bangs or wispy curtain bangs, remember to have fun and experiment with different styles until you find the perfect look for you!</p></article>

Apply a heat protectant spray or serum to protect your hair from heat damage. Section your hair into small sections and start brushing from the roots, moving towards the ends. To add volume, lift your hair at the roots while you brush. Repeat this process until you achieve your desired hairstyle.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Using a Hot Air Brush</h2><p>1.

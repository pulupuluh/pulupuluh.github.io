Read on to find out more about the best hairstyle for over 50s.</p><br/></section><section id="how-to"><h2>How to</h2><h3>1. Consider your hair type and face shape</h3><p>Before choosing a hairstyle, it is important to consider your hair type and face shape. If you have fine hair, go for a layered haircut to add volume. If you have thick hair, opt for a blunt cut to control the volume. For face shape, a short bob or pixie cut is great for oval or heart-shaped faces, while a medium-length haircut with layers is perfect for round faces.</p><br/><h3>2. Embrace your gray hair</h3><p>Gray hair can be beautiful and trendy. If you want to embrace your gray hair, go for a short pixie cut or a layered haircut that shows off your natural hair color. You can also add some highlights to enhance the gray and add dimension to your hair.</p><br/><h3>3. Add some highlights</h3><p>If you want to add some color to your hair, go for highlights. Highlights can add depth and dimension to your hair, making it look more youthful. Opt for subtle highlights that blend in with your natural hair color for a natural look.</p><br/><h3>4. Go for a low-maintenance hairstyle</h3><p>As we age, our hair can become thinner and more fragile. To avoid damaging your hair, go for a low-maintenance hairstyle. A short bob or a pixie cut is easy to style and requires minimal upkeep.</p><br/><h3>5. Consult with a hairstylist</h3><p>If you are unsure about which hairstyle to choose, consult with a hairstylist.

There are six basic face shapes: oval, round, square, heart, diamond, and oblong. To determine your face shape, pull your hair back and examine your face in the mirror. Look for the following features:</p><ul><li>Oval: Forehead is wider than chin, and cheekbones are prominent.</li><li>Round: Cheeks are full, and the width and length of the face are almost equal.</li><li>Square: Forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are almost equal in width.</li><li>Heart: Forehead is wider than the jawline, and the chin is pointed.</li><li>Diamond: Cheekbones are the widest part of the face, and the forehead and jawline are narrower.</li><li>Oblong: Face is longer than it is wide, with a prominent chin and forehead.</li></ul><p>Once you have determined your face shape, you can move on to the next step.</p><h2 id="step2">Step 2: Research Hairstyles That Suit Your Face Shape</h2><p>Now that you know your face shape, it's time to research hairstyles that suit your face shape.

If you have curly hair, for example, a short haircut may not be the best option.

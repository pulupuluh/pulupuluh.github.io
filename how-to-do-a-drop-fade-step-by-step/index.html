This will make it easier to work with and ensure a more even cut.</li><li>Decide how high up you want the fade to start. Typically, a drop fade starts just above the ears and gradually fades down the back of the head.</li><li>Using a higher guard size, such as a #3 or #4, trim the hair on top of your head to your desired length. Make sure to keep the hair at the front slightly longer than the hair at the back.</li><li>Switch to a lower guard size, such as a #2 or #1, and start to fade the hair. Start at the point where you want the fade to start and work your way down, gradually decreasing the guard size as you go.</li><li>Blend the fade by using a clipper without a guard. Gently fade the hair between the two lengths to create a smooth transition.</li><li>Use scissors to trim any excess hair that hasn't been cut by the clippers.

The key to a good fade is patience and precision.</li><li>Use a mirror to check your work from different angles.

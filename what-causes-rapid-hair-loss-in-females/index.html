Hormonal Changes: Hormonal imbalances during pregnancy, menopause, or thyroid disorders can lead to sudden hair loss in females. </p><p> 2. Stress and Anxiety: Emotional and physical stress can cause hair follicles to enter the resting phase prematurely, leading to hair loss. </p><p> 3.

Medications: Some medications like chemotherapy drugs, antidepressants, and blood thinners can cause hair loss as a side effect. </p><p> 5.

Here are some options to consider: </p><p> 1. Consult a Dermatologist: If you are experiencing sudden hair loss, it is essential to seek medical advice from a dermatologist who can diagnose the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment. </p><p> 2. Hair Transplant: For severe cases of hair loss, hair transplant surgery is an option that involves transplanting healthy hair follicles from the back of the scalp to the balding areas. </p><p> 3. Hair Extensions: Hair extensions can be a quick fix for thinning hair, but they should be used sparingly to avoid damaging the hair further. </p><p> 4.

Protect Hair from Heat: Avoid using hot styling tools like flat irons and curling irons that can damage the hair and cause it to break. </p><p> 4.

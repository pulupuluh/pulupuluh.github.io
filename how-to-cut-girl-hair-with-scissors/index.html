With the right tools and techniques, you can achieve a beautiful, professional-looking haircut. Here are some steps to follow:</p><h3>1. Start with Clean, Dry Hair</h3><p>Before you start cutting, it is essential to have clean, dry hair. Wet hair can be difficult to cut, and it can cause the hair to look shorter than you intended. So, make sure your client's hair is clean and dry.</p><h3>2. Section the Hair</h3><p>Section the hair into four sections by parting it in the middle and from ear to ear. Secure each section with clips, so they don't get in the way while you're cutting.</p><h3>3. Start at the Back</h3><p>Starting at the back of the head, take a small section of hair, comb it straight down, and hold it between your index and middle fingers. Place your fingers horizontally, so the hair is even. Use your scissors to cut the hair in a straight line.</p><h3>4. Move to the Sides</h3><p>After you have cut the back, move to the sides. Take a small section of hair on the left side, comb it straight down, and hold it between your index and middle fingers. Use the hair from the back as a guide to cut the hair in a straight line. Repeat on the right side.</p><h3>5. Cut the Bangs</h3><p>Finally, cut the bangs. Take a small section of hair, comb it straight down, and hold it between your index and middle fingers.

Side bangs are a perfect way to add a fresh, new look to your wavy hair. But cutting side bangs can be a bit intimidating, especially if you've never done it before. In this guide, we'll take you through the steps of how to cut side bangs for wavy hair.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to">How to Cut Side Bangs for Wavy Hair</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Instructions</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Cutting Side Bangs</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care for Wavy Hair with Side Bangs</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to Cut Side Bangs for Wavy Hair</h2><p>Cutting side bangs for wavy hair is not as difficult as it seems. Here are the basic steps:</p><h3>1. Gather Your Tools</h3><p>Before you start cutting, make sure you have the right tools. You'll need a pair of sharp scissors, a comb, and hair clips to section off your hair. It's also a good idea to have a spray bottle filled with water to keep your hair damp.</p><h3>2. Decide on the Length and Angle of Your Bangs</h3><p>The first step in cutting side bangs is to decide on the length and angle you want. Keep in mind that wavy hair tends to shrink up when it dries, so you may want to cut your bangs a bit longer than you initially planned. It's also a good idea to start with a longer length and then gradually cut more if needed.</p><h3>3. Section Off Your Hair</h3><p>Using hair clips, section off the hair you want to cut into a "V" shape. Make sure the point of the "V" is at the center of your forehead.</p><h3>4. Cut Your Bangs</h3><p>Starting at the center of your forehead, use your scissors to cut your bangs at the desired length and angle. Work your way outwards, cutting small sections at a time. Keep in mind that it's easier to cut more hair than to add it back, so take your time and cut slowly.</p><h3>5. Check for Symmetry</h3><p>After you've cut your bangs, check to make sure they're even on both sides. If needed, make small adjustments until they're symmetrical.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Instructions</h2><p>Now that you know the basic steps of cutting side bangs for wavy hair, here's a more detailed guide:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and drying your hair.

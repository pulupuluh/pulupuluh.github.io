This will help you see your hair's natural texture and make it easier to trim.</p><h3>Step 3: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into four parts using clips or hair ties. Start at the front and work your way back. This will make it easier to cut your hair evenly.</p><h3>Step 4: Choose Your Guard Size</h3><p>Choose the guard size you want to use for your clippers. For a shorter cut, use a smaller guard. For a longer cut, use a larger guard.</p><h3>Step 5: Start Cutting</h3><p>Start cutting your hair with the clippers, starting at the nape of your neck and working your way up. Use the comb to guide the clippers and make sure you are cutting your hair evenly. Go over each section of hair several times to ensure that you have cut it all.</p><h3>Step 6: Trim the Sides and Back</h3><p>Use the scissors to trim the sides and back of your hair.

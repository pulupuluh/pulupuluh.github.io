Other causes of stress-related hair loss include hormonal imbalances, nutritional deficiencies, and autoimmune disorders. </p><h2> How to Prevent Hair Loss from Stress </h2><p>If you're experiencing stress-related hair loss, there are steps you can take to prevent it from getting worse. One of the most important things you can do is manage your stress levels. This can include things like meditation, exercise, and therapy.

In this article, we'll show you how to get this haircut, how to style it, and how to take care of it. Let's get started!</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The guys hair long on top short sides haircut is characterized by long hair on the top of the head and shorter hair on the sides and back. The length of the hair on top can vary, but it's usually between 2 and 4 inches.

Be sure to bring a picture of the hairstyle you want, so that your stylist can get a better idea of what you're looking for. During the haircut, your stylist will use clippers and scissors to create the fade or taper on the sides and back, and will leave the hair on top longer.

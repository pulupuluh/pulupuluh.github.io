Look for a curl-enhancing shampoo and conditioner that will help to define your curls and add volume to your hair. You'll also need a curling iron or wand, hair clips, and a heat protectant spray.</p><p>Before you start, make sure your hair is clean and dry. Apply a heat protectant spray to your hair to prevent damage from the heat of the curling iron.</p><h3>Using a Curling Iron</h3><p>If you're using a curling iron, start by clipping up the top section of your hair. Take a small section of hair (about 1 inch wide) and wrap it around the curling iron, starting at the base of the hair and working your way to the ends. Hold the curl for 10-15 seconds and then release. Repeat this process for the rest of your hair.</p><p>Once you've curled all of your hair, use your fingers to loosen the curls and give them a more natural look. Finish with a light hold hairspray to keep your curls in place.</p><h3>Using a Curling Wand</h3><p>A curling wand is another great tool for making thin straight hair curly. To use a curling wand, take a small section of hair (about 1 inch wide) and wrap it around the wand, starting at the base of the hair and working your way to the ends. Hold the curl for 10-15 seconds and then release.

You'll need a pair of clippers, clipper guards, scissors, a comb, a mirror, and a clean towel or cape to catch hair clippings.

If you're not sure which ones to buy, look for reviews online or ask your hairdresser for recommendations.</p><h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2><p>Before you start cutting, make sure the hair is clean and dry. Wet hair can be harder to cut evenly, and it's also easier to see any dry or split ends when the hair is dry. Comb the hair in the direction it naturally falls and make sure it's free of tangles. If you're cutting someone else's hair, have them sit in a comfortable chair and drape the towel or cape over their shoulders to catch any hair clippings.</p><h2 id="cutting">Cutting</h2><p>Now it's time to start cutting. Begin by attaching the appropriate clipper guard to your clippers. Start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter one if needed. It's better to start longer and take more off than to cut too much at once. Start at the bottom of the hairline and work your way up, using the clippers to cut the hair in even strokes. Use the comb to lift the hair and make sure it's even on both sides.</p><p>Once you've finished with the clippers, switch to scissors to trim any longer hairs or uneven spots. Use the comb to lift the hair and cut it straight across. Take small sections at a time to ensure an even cut.

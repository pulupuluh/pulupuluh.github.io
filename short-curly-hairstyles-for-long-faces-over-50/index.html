For women with long faces over 50, adding volume and texture to their hair is crucial in creating a flattering look. Short curly hairstyles are an excellent option for women who want to add volume and texture to their hair while emphasizing their facial features.</p><h2>How to Choose the Right Short Curly Hairstyle for Long Faces Over 50</h2><p>Choosing the right short curly hairstyle for your long face over 50 can be a daunting task. Here are some tips to help you choose the right hairstyle:</p><h3>Consider Your Hair Texture</h3><p>Curly hair tends to have more volume, making it an excellent option for women with long faces over 50. However, it's essential to consider your hair texture before choosing a hairstyle. If you have fine hair, you may want to opt for a shorter cut to add volume and texture to your hair.</p><h3>Consider Your Face Shape</h3><p>When choosing a short curly hairstyle for your long face, it's essential to consider your face shape. A short curly bob or a pixie cut with textured layers is an excellent option for women with long faces. These hairstyles add volume to the hair, making it look fuller and thicker.</p><h3>Consider Your Lifestyle</h3><p>Your lifestyle should also play a significant role in choosing the right short curly hairstyle for your long face over 50. If you have an active lifestyle, you may want to opt for a shorter cut that requires minimal maintenance.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide to Styling Short Curly Hair for Long Faces Over 50</h2><p>Styling short curly hair can be challenging, but with the right products and techniques, you can achieve a beautiful and voluminous look. Here's a step-by-step guide to styling short curly hair for long faces over 50:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. Curly hair tends to be dry, so it's essential to use products that hydrate and nourish your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Hair Products</h3><p>Apply a curl-enhancing product to your hair, such as a mousse or cream. This will help define your curls and add volume to your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Blow-Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to dry your hair. This will help enhance your curls and add volume to your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Use a curling iron or wand to define your curls further. You can also use a styling cream or pomade to add texture to your hair.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Short Curly Hair for Long Faces Over 50</h2><p>Maintaining short curly hair requires regular maintenance to keep your curls looking voluminous and healthy.

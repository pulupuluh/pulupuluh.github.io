However, there are plenty of options out there that can accentuate your strong jawline and give you a stunning look. In this article, we'll discuss the best hairstyles for square faces in 2020, including how to style them, tips, and hair care advice.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#how-to">How to Determine Your Face Shape</a></li><li><a href="#best-hairstyles">Best Hairstyles for Square Faces</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care for Square Faces</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li></ol><h2 id="how-to">How to Determine Your Face Shape</h2><p>Before we dive into the best hairstyles for square faces, let's first determine if you have a square face shape. To do this, you'll need to measure your face using a tape measure or ruler. Here's how:</p><ol><li>Measure the width of your forehead at the widest point, which is typically just above your eyebrows.</li><li>Measure the width of your cheekbones at the widest point.</li><li>Measure the width of your jawline at the widest point.</li><li>Measure the length of your face from your hairline to your chin.</li></ol><p>If your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are all roughly the same width, and your face is on the shorter side, you likely have a square face shape.</p><h2 id="best-hairstyles">Best Hairstyles for Square Faces</h2><p>Now that you know you have a square face shape, let's take a look at some of the best hairstyles to flatter your features.</p><h3>1. Long Layers</h3><p>Long layers help to soften the angles of a square face shape, and can also add movement and dimension to your hair. Try parting your hair in the middle and adding long layers that frame your face.</p><h3>2. Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>Side-swept bangs are a great way to break up the width of a square face shape. They draw attention to your eyes and cheekbones, and can also make your face appear longer. Try pairing side-swept bangs with a long, layered haircut for a chic look.</p><h3>3. Pixie Cut</h3><p>For a bold and edgy look, consider a pixie cut. This short hairstyle can work well with a square face shape, as it accentuates your strong jawline. Try adding some texture to your pixie cut with layers or choppy ends.</p><h3>4. Bob</h3><p>A bob haircut can be a great option for square faces, as it can add volume to the crown of your head and elongate your face. Try a chin-length bob with layers that frame your face or a longer bob with side-swept bangs.</p><h3>5. Soft Waves</h3><p>Soft waves can help to soften the angles of a square face shape and add a romantic, feminine touch to your look. Try using a curling iron to create loose waves, or braid your hair the night before and let it loose in the morning for a natural wave.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care for Square Faces</h2><p>To keep your hair looking its best, it's important to take good care of it. Here are some hair care tips for square faces:</p><h3>1. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner</h3><p>Look for a shampoo and conditioner that are gentle on your hair and scalp. Avoid products that contain harsh chemicals or sulfates, as they can strip your hair of its natural oils.</p><h3>2. Protect your hair from heat</h3><p>If you use heat styling tools like a curling iron or straightener, be sure to use a heat protectant spray to prevent damage to your hair. Try to limit your use of these tools as much as possible, and let your hair air dry whenever you can.</p><h3>3. Get regular trims</h3><p>To keep your hair looking healthy and prevent split ends, be sure to get regular trims every six to eight weeks.</p><h3>4. Eat a healthy diet</h3><p>Eating a healthy diet that's rich in vitamins and minerals can help to promote healthy hair growth. Be sure to include plenty of protein, fruits, and vegetables in your diet.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>What hairstyles should square faces avoid?</h3><p>Square faces should generally avoid hairstyles that are too short or too flat, as these can make your face appear even squarer. Avoid blunt bangs and center parts, as they can accentuate your strong jawline.</p><h3>Can square faces pull off short hair?</h3><p>Yes, square faces can definitely pull off short hair! Consider a pixie cut or a bob with layers to accentuate your strong jawline.</p><h3>How often should I wash my hair?</h3><p>How often you should wash your hair depends on your hair type and lifestyle. If you have oily hair or work out frequently, you may need to wash your hair more often. However, if you have dry or curly hair, you may only need to wash it once or twice a week.</p><p>With these tips and hairstyle ideas, you're sure to find a look that flatters your square face shape and makes you feel confident and beautiful.</p></article>

Just make sure to ask your hairstylist for a haircut that suits your hair type and texture, and that adds volume without weighing down your hair.</p><h3>Q: Do I need to use special hair products for my medium layered hairstyle?</h3><p>A: While you don't necessarily need to use expensive or fancy hair products, it's important to choose ones that are formulated for your hair type and that address your specific hair concerns, such as dryness, frizz, or breakage. Look for products that contain natural ingredients, such as argan oil, jojoba oil, or shea butter, and that are free from harsh chemicals, such as sulfates, parabens, or silicones.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>To keep your medium layered hairstyle for over 60 looking its best, here are some hair care tips to follow:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair no more than 2-3 times a week to avoid stripping it of its natural oils and to prevent dryness and breakage.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to nourish and hydrate your hair, especially if you color it or use heat styling tools.</li><li>Avoid exposing your hair to excessive heat, such as from blow dryers or flat irons, and use a heat protectant spray or lotion when you do.</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun, wind, and pollution by wearing a hat or a scarf, especially if you spend a lot of time outdoors.</li><li>Eat a healthy and balanced diet that is rich in vitamins, minerals, and protein, as this will help to promote healthy hair growth and reduce hair loss.</li></ul><p>With these tips and tricks, you can rock a medium layered hairstyle for over 60 with confidence and style.

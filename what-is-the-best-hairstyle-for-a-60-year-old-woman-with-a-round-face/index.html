At 60, women's hair may become thinner and greyer, but that doesn't mean we have to sacrifice on style. In fact, there are several hairstyles that can flatter a round face and make us look younger and more vibrant. In this blog post, we will discuss the best hairstyle for a 60 year old woman with a round face, as well as provide tips on hair care and maintenance.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A round face is characterized by a circular shape and full cheeks. Women with round faces should aim for hairstyles that add height and volume to the crown of the head, as well as elongate the face. The best hairstyles for a round face are those that create angles and softness, such as layered cuts, side-swept bangs, and textured waves.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you're looking for a new hairstyle, consider the following options:</p><h3>1. Layered Cut</h3><p>A layered cut is perfect for adding texture and movement to your hair. Ask your stylist for long layers that start at the chin and frame your face. This will create angles and soften your features. You can also add side-swept bangs to further elongate your face.</p><h3>2. Bob with Bangs</h3><p>A classic bob with bangs is a timeless hairstyle that flatters all face shapes. For a round face, opt for a longer bob that falls just below the chin. Add side-swept bangs that skim the eyebrows to create angles and elongate your face.</p><h3>3. Pixie Cut</h3><p>If you're feeling daring, a pixie cut can be a chic and low-maintenance hairstyle. For a round face, ask your stylist for a longer pixie cut that adds height and volume to the crown of your head. You can also add side-swept bangs to soften your features.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Here are some steps you can follow to achieve the best hairstyle for a 60 year old woman with a round face:</p><h3>1. Consult with your stylist</h3><p>Before getting a new hairstyle, consult with your stylist to discuss which options would flatter your face shape and hair texture.</p><h3>2. Bring inspiration photos</h3><p>Bring photos of hairstyles you like to your appointment. This will give your stylist a better idea of what you're looking for.</p><h3>3. Consider maintenance</h3><p>Choose a hairstyle that fits your lifestyle and maintenance routine. If you have a busy schedule, opt for a low-maintenance style like a bob or pixie cut.</p><h3>4. Invest in hair care products</h3><p>Invest in quality hair care products that will keep your hair healthy and shiny. Use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to add volume and texture to your hair.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for maintaining your hair:</p><h3>1. Get regular trims</h3><p>Regular trims will keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends.</p><h3>2. Avoid heat styling</h3><p>Avoid excessive heat styling, as this can damage your hair and make it look dull and lifeless.</p><h3>3. Use a heat protectant</h3><p>If you do use heat styling tools, use a heat protectant to prevent damage to your hair.</p><h3>4. Embrace your natural texture</h3><p>Embrace your natural texture and work with it, rather than against it. If you have curly hair, use a curl-defining product to enhance your curls.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about the best hairstyle for a 60 year old woman with a round face:</p><h3>What if I have thin hair?</h3><p>If you have thin hair, opt for a layered cut that adds volume and texture to your hair. You can also use volumizing products to add height and fullness.</p><h3>What if I don't like bangs?</h3><p>If you don't like bangs, you can opt for a side part or a center part with layers that frame your face.</p><h3>What if I have a double chin?</h3><p>If you have a double chin, avoid hairstyles that are too short or too tight around the jawline. Instead, opt for longer hairstyles that add volume and texture to the crown of your head.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for maintaining healthy hair:</p><h3>1. Wash your hair regularly</h3><p>Wash your hair regularly to remove dirt and oil buildup.</p><h3>2. Use a deep conditioning treatment</h3><p>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to nourish and hydrate your hair.</p><h3>3. Protect your hair from the sun</h3><p>Protect your hair from the sun by wearing a hat or using a UV-protectant spray.</p><h3>4.

Whether you opt for a layered cut, a bob with bangs, or a pixie cut, choose a style that fits your lifestyle and maintenance routine. Remember to invest in quality hair care products and maintain regular trims to keep your hair healthy and shiny.</p></article>

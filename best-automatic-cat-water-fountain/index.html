One important aspect of their well-being is keeping them hydrated, and the best way to do that is by investing in an automatic cat water fountain. In this article, we'll discuss the best automatic cat water fountains in 2023, how to set them up, some tips to keep in mind, and answer some frequently asked questions. Let's dive in!</p><h2>Table of Content</h2><ul><li><a href="#description">Description</a></li><li><a href="#how-to">How to Set Up</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips to Keep in Mind</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ul><h2 id="description">Description</h2><p>An automatic cat water fountain is a device that provides a continuous supply of fresh water for your cat to drink from. It comes equipped with a pump that circulates the water, keeping it oxygenated and preventing it from becoming stagnant. This not only encourages your cat to drink more water but also helps to improve their overall health by reducing the risk of urinary tract infections and kidney problems.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Set Up</h2><p>Setting up an automatic cat water fountain is a fairly simple process. Here are the basic steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose a Location</h3><p>Find a suitable location for the fountain where your cat can easily access it but also away from any electrical outlets or cords to avoid any accidents. It should also be placed on a stable surface to prevent tipping over.</p><h3>Step 2: Assemble the Fountain</h3><p>Assemble the fountain according to the manufacturer's instructions. Most fountains come with a reservoir, pump, and filter. Make sure to rinse the filter under running water before inserting it into the fountain.</p><h3>Step 3: Fill the Reservoir</h3><p>Fill the reservoir with fresh water and plug in the fountain. The pump should start circulating the water immediately. Check the water level regularly and refill as needed.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a more detailed step-by-step guide to set up your automatic cat water fountain:</p><h3>Step 1: Unpack the Fountain</h3><p>Remove all the parts from the packaging and ensure that you have everything needed to assemble the fountain.</p><h3>Step 2: Rinse the Filter</h3><p>Remove the filter from its packaging and rinse it thoroughly under running water. This helps to remove any dust or debris that may have accumulated during storage.</p><h3>Step 3: Assemble the Fountain</h3><p>Follow the manufacturer's instructions to assemble the fountain. This usually involves attaching the pump to the filter, then attaching the filter to the fountain's base. Make sure everything fits snugly and securely.</p><h3>Step 4: Fill the Reservoir</h3><p>Fill the reservoir with fresh water, making sure not to exceed the maximum fill line. Replace the lid and plug in the fountain. The pump should start circulating the water immediately.</p><h3>Step 5: Monitor the Water Level</h3><p>Check the water level regularly and refill as needed. The fountain should have a minimum and maximum fill line to guide you on how much water to add.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips to Keep in Mind</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your automatic cat water fountain:</p><h3>Tip 1: Clean the Fountain Regularly</h3><p>Clean the fountain every week to prevent the growth of bacteria and algae. This involves disassembling the fountain, washing each part with soap and water, and thoroughly rinsing before reassembling.</p><h3>Tip 2: Change the Filter Regularly</h3><p>Change the filter every four weeks or as recommended by the manufacturer. This helps to maintain water quality and prolong the lifespan of the pump.</p><h3>Tip 3: Try Different Water Temperatures</h3><p>Some cats prefer cold water, while others like it at room temperature. Experiment with different water temperatures to see what your cat prefers.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Q: How often should I clean the fountain?</h3><p>A: You should clean the fountain every week to prevent the growth of bacteria and algae.</p><h3>Q: How often should I change the filter?</h3><p>A: You should change the filter every four weeks or as recommended by the manufacturer.</p><h3>Q: Can I use tap water in the fountain?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can use tap water in the fountain, but it's recommended to use filtered water to prolong the lifespan of the pump and improve water quality.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care</h2><p>One downside of automatic cat water fountains is that they can attract cat hair and debris, which can clog the pump and affect water flow. To prevent this, brush your cat regularly to minimize shedding and place the fountain in an area away from high traffic or windy spots. You can also use a cat water fountain with a pre-filter to trap hair and debris before it reaches the pump.</p><p>In conclusion, investing in an automatic cat water fountain is a great way to keep your feline hydrated and healthy. Follow the steps outlined in this article to set up your fountain, and keep in mind the tips and FAQs to ensure it functions properly. Your cat will thank you for it!</p></article>

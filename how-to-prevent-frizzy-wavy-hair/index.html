Frizz occurs when hair is dry and lacks moisture, which can be caused by a number of factors including humidity, heat styling, and harsh chemicals. By taking steps to keep your hair hydrated and protected, you can help prevent frizz and keep your hair looking smooth and shiny.</p><h3>Here are some tips for preventing frizzy wavy hair:</h3><h4>1. Use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner</h4><p>Start by using a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner that is specifically designed for your hair type. Look for products that contain ingredients like glycerin, shea butter, and coconut oil, which can help hydrate and nourish your hair.</p><h4>2. Avoid heat styling</h4><p>Heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons can damage your hair and cause it to become dry and brittle. If you must use heat styling tools, be sure to use a heat protectant spray and keep the temperature as low as possible.</p><h4>3. Use a leave-in conditioner</h4><p>A leave-in conditioner can help keep your hair hydrated throughout the day. Apply a small amount to damp hair before styling to help prevent frizz and keep your hair looking smooth and shiny.</p><h4>4. Don't over-wash your hair</h4><p>Washing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils, leaving it dry and prone to frizz. Try to wash your hair no more than every other day, and use a gentle shampoo that won't strip your hair of its natural oils.</p><h4>5. Use a wide-tooth comb</h4><p>A wide-tooth comb can help detangle your hair without causing damage or breakage.

Flyaways can be caused by several factors, including dryness, static, and humidity. Once you know the cause, you can choose the appropriate solution. Here are some ways to tame the flyaways on top of your head: </p><h3> 1. Use a Hair Serum </h3><p> Hair serums are a great way to tame flyaways and add shine to your hair.

Spray a small amount of hairspray on a toothbrush and gently brush the flyaways down. This technique is especially useful for those with curly hair. </p><h3> 4.

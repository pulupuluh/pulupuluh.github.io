The style is popular among people with natural hair, as it allows them to embrace their hair's natural texture and create a unique look. Making dreads with short natural hair can be challenging, but with the right technique, it is possible to achieve the look you desire.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Make Dreads with Short Natural Hair</h2><p>The key to making dreads with short natural hair is to start with clean, dry hair. You will also need a few essential tools, including a comb, hair clips, and dread wax or gel. Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h3><ol><li>Wash and dry your hair thoroughly. Use a clarifying shampoo to remove any product buildup or oil from your scalp.</li><li>Section your hair into small parts using a comb. Clip each section to keep it separate.</li><li>Apply a small amount of dread wax or gel to the first section of hair. Rub it between your palms to warm it up before applying it to your hair.</li><li>Starting at the root, twist the hair in a clockwise direction. Keep twisting until you reach the end of the section. Repeat this process for each section of hair.</li><li>After twisting each section, use a hair clip to hold the dread in place. This will help it set and prevent it from unraveling.</li><li>Leave the hair clips in place for at least two days to allow the dreads to set.</li><li>After two days, remove the hair clips and gently separate the dreads using your fingers. Be careful not to pull too hard, as this can damage your hair.</li><li>Use a crochet hook to tighten any loose spots in the dreads. Insert the hook at the base of the dread and pull it through to the end.</li><li>Repeat this process for each dread, taking care not to damage your hair.</li><li>Once you have tightened all the dreads, apply a small amount of dread wax or gel to your scalp to prevent itching and flaking.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Making Dreads with Short Natural Hair</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help you make dreads with short natural hair:</p><ul><li>Be patient. It can take several months for your dreads to fully form, so don't be discouraged if they don't look perfect right away.</li><li>Avoid using too much product. Overusing dread wax or gel can cause buildup and prevent your dreads from matting properly.</li><li>Avoid using a hairdryer. Heat can cause damage to your hair, so it's best to let your dreads air dry.</li><li>Keep your scalp clean.

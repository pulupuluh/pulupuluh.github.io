It's important to read product labels and choose products that are gentle and nourishing for your hair.</p><h3>Can a poor diet cause hair loss?</h3><p>Yes, a poor diet can contribute to hair loss. It's important to eat a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals to support hair health.</p><h3>Is it normal to lose hair every day?</h3><p>Yes, it is normal to lose some hair every day.

However, if you are experiencing excessive hair loss, it may be a sign of an underlying condition.</p><h3>Can hair loss be caused by wearing hats?</h3><p>No, wearing hats does not cause hair loss.

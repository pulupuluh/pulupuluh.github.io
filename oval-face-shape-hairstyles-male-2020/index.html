This face shape is considered the most versatile and can pull off almost any hairstyle. However, with so many options available, it can be overwhelming to choose the perfect hairstyle that suits your personality, style, and face shape. In this article, we'll discuss the top oval face shape hairstyles for men in 2023, along with tips on how to style them and maintain them.</p><h2>How to Determine if You Have an Oval Face Shape</h2><p>Before we dive into the hairstyles, it's essential to determine if you have an oval face shape. An oval-shaped face is longer than it is wide, with a rounded hairline and jawline. Your forehead and jawline are slightly narrower than your cheekbones, and your face is symmetrical. If you're still unsure, take a ruler and measure the length and width of your face. If your face length is 1.5 times your face width, you have an oval face shape.</p><h2>Top Oval Face Shape Hairstyles for Men in 2023</h2><h3>1. Short Textured Crop</h3><p>The short textured crop is a modern and stylish hairstyle that works well for oval face shapes. The textured layers add volume and dimension to your hair, while the short length keeps it low maintenance. You can style this haircut with a side part, messy fringe, or slicked back look, depending on your preference.</p><h3>2. Classic Side Part</h3><p>The classic side part is a timeless hairstyle that never goes out of style. It works well for oval face shapes, as it adds definition to your face and creates a sharp, sophisticated look. You can pair this haircut with a well-groomed beard or go clean-shaven for a more professional look.</p><h3>3. Medium Length Waves</h3><p>If you have wavy or curly hair, the medium-length waves hairstyle is perfect for you. This hairstyle adds volume and texture to your hair, creating a relaxed, beachy vibe. You can style this haircut with a side part or a messy, tousled look for a more laid-back appearance.</p><h3>4. Buzz Cut</h3><p>The buzz cut is a classic and low-maintenance hairstyle that works well for oval face shapes. It highlights your facial features and creates a clean, sharp look. You can opt for a short buzz cut or a longer one, depending on your preference.</p><h3>5. Slicked Back Undercut</h3><p>The slicked-back undercut is a trendy and edgy hairstyle that works well for oval face shapes. The undercut creates a contrast between the short sides and the longer top, while the slicked-back look adds a touch of sophistication. You can pair this haircut with a well-groomed beard or go clean-shaven for a more dramatic look.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide on How to Style Your Oval Face Shape Hairstyle</h2><p>Once you've chosen your hairstyle, it's essential to know how to style it correctly.

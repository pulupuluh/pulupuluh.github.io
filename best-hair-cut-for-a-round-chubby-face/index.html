You will also learn how to take care of your hair and maintain your new look.</p><br/></section><section id="how-to"><h2>How to Choose the Best Hair Cut for a Round Chubby Face</h2><p>The first step to choosing the best hair cut for a round chubby face is to determine your face shape. You can do this by measuring your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline. If they are all similar in width and your face has soft curves, you have a round face shape. Once you know your face shape, you can look for hair cuts that will balance your features and elongate your face. Some of the best hair cuts for a round chubby face include:</p><ul><li><strong>Long layers:</strong> This hair cut adds volume and movement to your hair, creating an illusion of length and slimness. You can also add side-swept bangs to frame your face and draw attention away from your cheeks.</li><li><strong>A-line bob:</strong> This hair cut is shorter in the back and longer in the front, creating an angle that elongates your face. You can also add layers and texture to add volume and dimension.</li><li><strong>Side-swept pixie:</strong> This hair cut is short and edgy, but the side-swept bangs create a diagonal line that slims down your face. You can also add layers and texture to create volume and movement.</li><li><strong>Shoulder-length waves:</strong> This hair cut is perfect if you want to keep your hair long but still enhance your features. The waves create texture and movement, while the length adds balance to your face.</li><li><strong>Asymmetrical lob:</strong> This hair cut is longer on one side and shorter on the other, creating a diagonal line that elongates your face.

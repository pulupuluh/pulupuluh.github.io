As we age, our hairstyles can often become outdated and may not suit our changing features. Short hairstyles can be a great option for women over 60 as they can be low maintenance, flattering and modern. In this guide, we will provide you with a variety of short hairstyles that can suit your face shape, hair texture and personal style. </p><h2>How to Choose the Best Short Hairstyle for You</h2><p>Before choosing a short hairstyle, it is important to consider your face shape, hair texture and personal style. Here are some tips to help you choose the right hairstyle:</p><h3>Face Shape</h3><p>The shape of your face can greatly influence the type of hairstyle that will suit you. Generally, women over 60 have a round, square, heart or oval face shape. Here are some hairstyles that can suit each face shape:</p><ul><li>Round face shape: Short layered hairstyles, pixie cut or a bob with side-swept bangs</li><li>Square face shape: Short hairstyles with soft layers or a bob with side bangs</li><li>Heart face shape: Pixie cut, short layered hairstyles or a bob with side-swept bangs</li><li>Oval face shape: Almost any short hairstyle can suit an oval face shape</li></ul><h3>Hair Texture</h3><p>The texture of your hair can also impact the type of hairstyle that will suit you. If you have fine hair, you may want to choose a hairstyle that adds volume and texture. If you have thick hair, you may want to choose a hairstyle that thins out your hair and adds movement. Here are some hairstyles that can suit different hair textures:</p><ul><li>Fine hair: Pixie cut, short bob, or a layered haircut with side-swept bangs</li><li>Thick hair: Short layered hairstyles, textured bob or a pixie cut</li><li>Straight hair: Bob with side-swept bangs or a pixie cut</li><li>Curly hair: Short layered hairstyles or a pixie cut</li></ul><h3>Personal Style</h3><p>Lastly, it is important to consider your personal style when choosing a short hairstyle. Do you prefer a classic or modern look? Do you like bold or subtle hairstyles? Here are some hairstyles that can suit different personal styles:</p><ul><li>Classic style: Bob with side-swept bangs or a layered haircut with soft waves</li><li>Modern style: Pixie cut or a short bob with choppy layers</li><li>Bold style: Textured bob or a short layered haircut with a bold hair color</li><li>Subtle style: Pixie cut or a short bob with subtle highlights</li></ul><h2>Step by Step Guide to Styling Short Hair</h2><p>Now that you have chosen a short hairstyle, it is important to know how to style it. Here is a step by step guide to styling short hair:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner</li><li>Towel dry your hair, but do not rub it vigorously as this can damage your hair</li><li>Apply a styling product such as a mousse or a styling cream to your hair</li><li>Blow dry your hair using a round brush to add volume and texture</li><li>Use a flat iron or curling iron to add waves or curls to your hair</li><li>Finish with a hairspray to hold your hairstyle in place</li></ol><h2>Tips for Maintaining Short Hair</h2><p>Short hairstyles can be low maintenance, but they still require some upkeep to keep them looking their best. Here are some tips for maintaining short hair:</p><ul><li>Get regular trims to keep your hairstyle looking fresh</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair as this can damage it</li><li>Use a dry shampoo in between washes to keep your hair looking clean and fresh</li><li>Protect your hair from the sun by wearing a hat or using a UV protection spray</li><li>Try different styling products to find the ones that work best for your hair type</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What are the best short hairstyles for fine hair?</h3><p>Pixie cut, short bob and a layered haircut with side-swept bangs can be great options for fine hair as they can add volume and texture.</p><h3>What are the best short hairstyles for thick hair?</h3><p>Short layered hairstyles, textured bob and a pixie cut can be great options for thick hair as they can thin out your hair and add movement.</p><h3>Can I still wear bangs with a short hairstyle?</h3><p>Yes, you can still wear bangs with a short hairstyle.

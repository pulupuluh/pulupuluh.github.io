It's a common question, and the answer is yes. Newborns often lose hair on their head in the first few months of life. In this article, we'll explore why this happens, when it occurs, and what you can do to care for your baby's hair during this time.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#why">Why do newborns lose hair on their head?</a></li><li><a href="#when">When does hair loss typically occur?</a></li><li><a href="#care">How to care for your baby's hair during this time</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for dealing with hair loss in newborns</a></li><li><a href="#faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></li></ul><h2 id="why">Why do newborns lose hair on their head?</h2><p>Newborns can lose hair on their head for a few different reasons. Firstly, it's normal for babies to lose some of the hair they were born with. This hair is called lanugo, and it's a fine, downy hair that covers the body in utero. Lanugo usually sheds within the first few weeks of life.</p><p>In addition to lanugo, some babies may also lose hair due to a condition called telogen effluvium. This occurs when the hair follicles on the scalp enter the resting phase of their growth cycle prematurely. Telogen effluvium can be triggered by a variety of factors, including stress, hormonal changes, and nutrient deficiencies.</p><h2 id="when">When does hair loss typically occur?</h2><p>Hair loss in newborns typically occurs within the first few months of life. It can start as early as a few weeks after birth, or it may not occur until the baby is several months old. The timing varies from baby to baby, and it's important to remember that it's a normal part of the newborn experience.</p><h2 id="care">How to care for your baby's hair during this time</h2><p>While hair loss in newborns is normal and usually not a cause for concern, there are a few things you can do to care for your baby's hair during this time:</p><ul><li>Gently wash your baby's hair with a mild shampoo</li><li>Use a soft brush or comb to detangle the hair</li><li>Avoid using hair accessories or tight hats that could pull on the hair</li></ul><p>It's important to note that you shouldn't be too concerned about your baby's hair loss.

If you're concerned about your baby's hair loss, talk to your pediatrician.</p><h3>Can I use hair products on my baby's hair?</h3><p>It's generally not necessary to use hair products on your baby's hair during this time.

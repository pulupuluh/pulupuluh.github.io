It can be frustrating, especially when trying to style your hair. Fortunately, there are several tips and tricks you can use to tame those unruly strands. In this article, we’ll cover how to fix hair sticking out on sides in relaxed English language, including step-by-step instructions, tips, and hair care advice.</p><h2>Table of Contents:</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to">How to Fix Hair Sticking Out on Sides</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Instructions</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Taming Unruly Hair</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care Advice</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to Fix Hair Sticking Out on Sides</h2><p>The first step in fixing hair that sticks out on the sides is to determine the cause. If your hair is naturally curly, it may be more prone to frizz and flyaways. If you’ve recently had a haircut, your hair may be growing out and not laying flat yet. Or, if you’ve been using too many styling products, they may be weighing your hair down and causing it to stick out.</p><p>Once you’ve identified the cause, you can take steps to fix the problem. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Use a Smoothing Serum</h3><p>A smoothing serum can help tame frizz and flyaways, making your hair look sleek and smooth. Apply a small amount to your fingertips and work it through your hair, focusing on the areas that stick out on the sides.</p><h3>2. Blow Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Blow drying your hair can help smooth it out and make it look more polished. Use a round brush to lift your hair at the roots and create volume, then blow dry on a low heat setting. Focus on the areas that stick out on the sides, using the brush to smooth them down.</p><h3>3. Use a Flat Iron</h3><p>If your hair is particularly stubborn, a flat iron can help smooth it out. Use a low heat setting and work in small sections, starting at the roots and working your way down to the ends. Be sure to use a heat protectant spray to prevent damage to your hair.</p><h3>4. Try a Different Haircut</h3><p>If your hair is growing out and not laying flat, it may be time for a trim. Ask your stylist to add layers or texture to your hair, which can help it lay flatter and look more polished.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Instructions</h2><p>Here’s a step-by-step guide to fixing hair that sticks out on the sides:</p><ol><li>Identify the cause of the problem (frizz, growing out, styling product buildup, etc.)</li><li>Apply a smoothing serum to your hair, focusing on the areas that stick out on the sides.</li><li>Blow dry your hair on a low heat setting, using a round brush to smooth it out.</li><li>If necessary, use a flat iron on a low heat setting to smooth out any stubborn strands.</li><li>Consider getting a haircut with layers or texture to help your hair lay flatter and look more polished.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Taming Unruly Hair</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for taming hair that sticks out on the sides:</p><ul><li>Avoid using too many styling products, as they can weigh your hair down and make it look greasy.</li><li>Use a wide-tooth comb instead of a brush to detangle your hair, as brushes can cause breakage and damage.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools too often, as they can damage your hair and make it more prone to frizz and flyaways.</li><li>Consider using a leave-in conditioner to keep your hair moisturized and healthy.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about fixing hair that sticks out on the sides:</p><h3>Q: Why does my hair stick out on the sides?</h3><p>A: There are several possible causes, including frizz, growing out, and styling product buildup.</p><h3>Q: What can I do to fix hair that sticks out on the sides?</h3><p>A: You can use a smoothing serum, blow dry your hair, use a flat iron, try a different haircut, and more.</p><h3>Q: How often should I use heat styling tools on my hair?</h3><p>A: It’s best to limit heat styling to once or twice a week to prevent damage to your hair.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Advice</h2><p>Finally, here are some general hair care tips to keep your hair healthy and looking its best:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair every 2-3 days, using a gentle shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Avoid using hot water on your hair, as it can strip it of its natural oils and cause damage.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair moisturized and healthy.</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it’s wet, as it can cause breakage and damage.</li><li>Consider getting regular trims to keep your hair looking healthy and prevent split ends.</li></ul><p>By following these tips and tricks, you can fix hair that sticks out on the sides and achieve the sleek, polished look you desire. Remember to be gentle with your hair, avoid using too many styling products, and take good care of it to keep it healthy and looking its best.</p></article>

Things for Hair in 2019 Fat face</u></center></a></figcaption></figure><p>If you're considering getting a short haircut, you may be wondering if your face will look fatter with the new style. This is a common concern, as many people believe that long hair can help to slim down the face. However, the truth is that the length of your hair isn't the only factor that can affect the appearance of your face. In this article, we'll explore whether or not your face will look fatter with short hair and provide some tips and advice to help you make the right decision for your hair and face shape.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Short haircuts can be a great way to change up your look and make a bold statement. However, if you're worried about your face looking fatter with the new style, it's important to understand the factors that can affect the appearance of your face shape. Your face shape, hair texture, and the length and style of your haircut can all play a role in how your face looks with short hair.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you're considering a short haircut, there are a few things you can do to help determine whether or not your face will look fatter with the new style:</p><ul><li>Look at pictures of people with similar face shapes and hair textures who have short haircuts. This can give you an idea of how the style will look on you.</li><li>Talk to your hairstylist about the best haircut for your face shape and hair texture. They can provide advice and recommendations based on their expertise.</li><li>Consider trying a shorter style gradually. You can gradually cut your hair shorter over time to see how it looks and feels on you.</li></ul><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>If you decide to go for a short haircut, here are some tips to help you choose the best style for your face shape:</p><ul><li>Round faces: Choose a haircut that adds height to the crown of your head and has layers that fall below the chin.</li><li>Oval faces: You can wear almost any short haircut, but a pixie cut or a bob with bangs can be particularly flattering.</li><li>Square faces: Look for a short haircut with soft layers and a side-swept fringe.</li><li>Heart-shaped faces: Choose a haircut with layers that fall around the jawline and a side-swept fringe.</li></ul><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help you get the most out of your short haircut:</p><ul><li>Use styling products to add volume and texture to your hair.</li><li>Consider getting highlights or lowlights to add dimension to your hair.</li><li>Experiment with different hair accessories, such as headbands and hairpins, to add interest to your style.</li><li>Visit your hairstylist regularly to keep your haircut looking fresh and stylish.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about whether or not your face will look fatter with short hair:</p><h3>Will a short haircut make my face look wider?</h3><p>It depends on your face shape and the style of your haircut. Short haircuts can help to elongate a round face or soften a square jawline, but they may not be as flattering on heart-shaped faces or faces with prominent foreheads. Talk to your hairstylist about the best haircut for your face shape.</p><h3>Can I wear a pixie cut if I have a round face?</h3><p>Yes, but you may want to choose a pixie cut with longer layers that fall around the jawline to help elongate the face. A side-swept fringe can also help to add length to a round face.</p><h3>What hairstyles should I avoid if I have a square face?</h3><p>Avoid hairstyles with blunt bangs or straight, heavy layers. Look for a short haircut with soft layers and a side-swept fringe to help soften the angles of your face.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Short haircuts can be low maintenance, but it's still important to take care of your hair to keep it healthy and looking great. Here are some hair care tips for short hair:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair every two to three days to keep it clean and fresh.</li><li>Use a shampoo and conditioner that are formulated for your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as this can cause damage and breakage.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair soft and hydrated.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to keep it looking neat and healthy.</li></ul><p>Overall, whether or not your face will look fatter with short hair depends on a variety of factors. By considering your face shape, hair texture, and the style of your haircut, you can find a short hairstyle that flatters your features and makes you feel confident and stylish.</p></article>

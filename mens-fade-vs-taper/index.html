While they may sound similar, they actually refer to two different haircuts. In this article, we'll break down the differences between mens fade vs taper haircuts.</p><h2>What is a Fade?</h2><p>A fade is a type of haircut where the hair gradually becomes shorter from the top of the head down to the sides and back. The fade can be high or low, which refers to how high up on the head the shortest part of the hair is cut. A high fade will have very short hair up to the temple, while a low fade will have longer hair up to the ear.</p><p>The fade is a popular haircut for men of all ages and can be worn with a variety of styles, including buzz cuts, crew cuts, and pompadours. It's a versatile haircut that can be dressed up or down, depending on the occasion.</p><h2>What is a Taper?</h2><p>A taper is a type of haircut where the hair gradually becomes shorter from the top of the head down to the nape of the neck. Unlike a fade, which has a very short length at the sides and back, a taper leaves some length at the bottom. Tapers can be short or long, and can be worn with a variety of styles.</p><p>Tapers are a great option for men who want a more natural-looking haircut that is easy to maintain. They're also a good choice for men who want to keep some length at the bottom of their hair but still have a clean, polished look.</p><h2>How to Get a Fade</h2><p>If you're interested in getting a fade, it's important to find a stylist who has experience with this type of haircut. To get a fade, your stylist will use clippers to gradually shorten the length of your hair from the top down to the sides and back. They'll blend the different lengths together to create a smooth, seamless transition.</p><p>When getting a fade, it's important to communicate with your stylist about the length you want and the style you're going for. This will help ensure that you get a haircut that you're happy with.</p><h2>How to Get a Taper</h2><p>To get a taper, your stylist will use clippers to gradually shorten the length of your hair from the top down to the nape of your neck.

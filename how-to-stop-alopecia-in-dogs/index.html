Alopecia is a condition in which dogs experience hair loss. Although it is a common issue, it can be frustrating for you as a dog owner. This article will provide you with tips and tricks on how to stop alopecia in dogs. </p><h2>What is Alopecia?</h2><p>Alopecia is a medical condition in which dogs experience hair loss.

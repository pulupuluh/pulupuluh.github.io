This hairstyle is perfect for a casual or formal look.</p><h3>The Top Knot</h3><p>The top knot is similar to the man bun, but the hair is gathered at the top of the head instead of the crown. To achieve the look, gather your hair into a high ponytail and twist it into a knot. Secure the knot with a hair tie or bobby pins. This hairstyle is perfect for a trendy and edgy look.</p><h3>The Messy Fringe</h3><p>The messy fringe is a great option for guys with long hair on top who want a more relaxed look. To achieve the look, let your hair fall naturally over your forehead and use a styling product, such as a pomade or wax, to create a messy texture. This hairstyle is perfect for a casual look.</p><h3>The Slicked-Back Look</h3><p>The slicked-back look is a classic and sophisticated hairstyle for guys with long hair on top.

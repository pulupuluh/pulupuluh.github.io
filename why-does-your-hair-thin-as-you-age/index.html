As you age, your body may produce less of certain hormones, such as estrogen or testosterone.

When you are under stress, your body produces more of the hormone cortisol. This can cause hair follicles to enter a resting phase, resulting in hair thinning and loss.</p><h3 id="nutrition">Nutrition and Hair Thinning</h3><p>Your diet can also play a role in hair thinning. If you are not getting enough nutrients, such as iron or protein, your hair may become thin and brittle. Additionally, crash diets or extreme weight loss can also lead to hair thinning.</p><h3 id="medications">Medications and Hair Thinning</h3><p>Finally, certain medications can also contribute to hair thinning.

It is a low-maintenance wig style that looks trendy and fashionable. However, after wearing it for a while, it can become a bit messy and tangled. That's why we created this guide to show you how to fix pixie cut wig and keep it looking fresh and fabulous.</p><h2>How to Fix Pixie Cut Wig</h2><p>If you own a pixie cut wig, then you may have experienced some challenges in keeping it looking great. Here are some tips to help you fix your wig:</p><h3>1. Detangle the Wig</h3><p>The first step in fixing your pixie cut wig is to detangle it. Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to gently comb through the wig, starting from the ends and working your way up to the roots. Be careful not to pull the hair too hard, as this can damage the wig. </p><h3>2. Wash the Wig</h3><p>If your wig is looking dull or greasy, it may be time to wash it. Fill a sink with cool water and add a small amount of wig shampoo. Gently swirl the wig in the water, being careful not to rub or twist the hair. Rinse the wig thoroughly with cool water and gently squeeze out the excess water. </p><h3>3. Style the Wig</h3><p>Once your wig is clean and dry, it's time to style it. Use a wig comb or brush to style the hair, starting from the roots and working your way to the ends. You can also use a styling product, such as a mousse or gel, to add volume or hold to your wig. </p><h2>Step by Step Guide to Fix Pixie Cut Wig</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide to help you fix your pixie cut wig:</p><h3>Step 1: Detangle the Wig</h3><p>Start by detangling the wig using a wide-tooth comb or your fingers.

Gently swirl the wig in the water, being careful not to rub or twist the hair. Rinse the wig thoroughly with cool water and gently squeeze out the excess water.</p><h3>Step 3: Dry the Wig</h3><p>Lay the wig flat on a towel and gently pat it dry. Avoid rubbing or twisting the hair, as this can cause damage. Once the wig is mostly dry, you can use a wig stand to finish drying it.</p><h3>Step 4: Style the Wig</h3><p>Use a wig comb or brush to style the hair, starting from the roots and working your way to the ends. You can also use a styling product, such as a mousse or gel, to add volume or hold to your wig.</p><h2>Tips for Fixing Pixie Cut Wig</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help you fix your pixie cut wig:</p><h3>1.

Not only can it be damaging, but it also takes up a lot of time. Fortunately, there are ways to achieve curls without using heat. In this article, we will discuss how to make hair curly after shower no heat.</p><h2>Table of Content</h2><ul><li><a href="#howto">How to</a></li><li><a href="#stepbystep">Step by Step</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#haircare">Hair Care</a></li></ul><h2 id="howto">How to</h2><p>Before we get started, it's important to understand that there are different methods to achieve curls without heat. Some of these methods may work better for certain hair types than others, so it may take some trial and error to find the one that works best for you.</p><p>That being said, here are a few methods to try:</p><h3>Method 1: Braids</h3><p>After showering, divide your hair into sections and braid each section. The tighter the braid, the tighter the curl will be. Leave the braids in overnight or until your hair is completely dry. Once you take the braids out, you should have beautiful, natural-looking curls.</p><h3>Method 2: Twists</h3><p>Similar to the braids method, separate your hair into sections and twist each section. Again, the tighter the twist, the tighter the curl will be. Leave the twists in overnight or until your hair is completely dry. When you take the twists out, you should have defined, bouncy curls.</p><h3>Method 3: Rollers</h3><p>While this method requires a bit more effort, it can result in some stunning curls. After showering, section your hair and roll each section onto a roller. Leave the rollers in until your hair is completely dry. Once you take the rollers out, you should have voluminous, bouncy curls.</p><h2 id="stepbystep">Step by Step</h2><h3>Method 1: Braids</h3><ol><li>Wash your hair and towel dry it.</li><li>Divide your hair into sections.</li><li>Braid each section tightly.</li><li>Leave the braids in overnight or until your hair is completely dry.</li><li>Take the braids out and enjoy your natural-looking curls.</li></ol><h3>Method 2: Twists</h3><ol><li>Wash your hair and towel dry it.</li><li>Divide your hair into sections.</li><li>Twist each section tightly.</li><li>Leave the twists in overnight or until your hair is completely dry.</li><li>Take the twists out and enjoy your defined, bouncy curls.</li></ol><h3>Method 3: Rollers</h3><ol><li>Wash your hair and towel dry it.</li><li>Section your hair.</li><li>Roll each section onto a roller.</li><li>Leave the rollers in until your hair is completely dry.</li><li>Take the rollers out and enjoy your voluminous, bouncy curls.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><ul><li>Use a leave-in conditioner or curl-enhancing product to help define your curls.</li><li>If you want looser curls, try using larger rollers or braiding/twisting your hair less tightly.</li><li>If you want tighter curls, try using smaller rollers or braiding/twisting your hair more tightly.</li><li>For best results, make sure your hair is completely dry before taking out the braids/twists/rollers.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Can I use these methods on all hair types?</h3><p>While these methods can work on most hair types, the results may vary depending on your hair's texture and thickness.

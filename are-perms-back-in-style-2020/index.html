Perms have made a comeback in recent years, and they're not going anywhere in 2023. If you're considering getting a perm, this guide will tell you everything you need to know about the trend, including how to get a perm, step-by-step instructions, tips, frequently asked questions, and hair care tips.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#description">Description</a></li><li><a href="#how-to">How To</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by Step</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ul><h3 id="description">Description</h3><p>Perms have been around for a long time, but they fell out of fashion in the 2000s. However, in recent years, perms have made a comeback, and they're now one of the hottest hair trends of the year. Perming is the process of adding permanent curls or waves to your hair using chemicals. The result is bouncy, curly hair that looks great on any hair length or texture.</p><h3 id="how-to">How To</h3><p>If you're thinking of getting a perm, the first thing you need to do is find a hairstylist who specializes in perms. Next, you'll need to decide on the type of perm you want. There are two types of perm: digital and traditional. Digital perms use heat and chemicals to create curls, while traditional perms use chemicals only. Digital perms result in looser, more natural-looking curls, while traditional perms create tighter, more defined curls.</p><h3 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h3><p>The process of getting a perm involves several steps. The first step is to wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove any build-up or residue. Next, your hair will be wrapped around perm rods or rollers, and a perming solution will be applied to your hair. The solution is left on for a set amount of time, depending on the type of perm you're getting. After the solution has set, your hair will be rinsed, and a neutralizer will be applied to set the curls.</p><h3 id="tips">Tips</h3><p>Before getting a perm, it's important to make sure your hair is healthy and not damaged. If your hair is damaged, the perming solution can cause further damage and breakage. It's also important to communicate with your hairstylist about the type of perm you want and the level of curl you're looking for. A good hairstylist will be able to recommend the best type of perm for your hair type and texture.</p><h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3><p>Q: How long does a perm last?</p><p>A: Perms typically last 3-6 months, depending on how fast your hair grows and how well you take care of your curls.</p><p>Q: Can I color my hair after getting a perm?</p><p>A: It's best to wait at least a week after getting a perm before coloring your hair. Coloring your hair too soon after a perm can cause damage and breakage.</p><h3 id="hair-care">Hair Care</h3><p>After getting a perm, it's important to take care of your curls to keep them looking their best. This includes using a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner, avoiding heat styling tools, and using a leave-in conditioner to keep your curls hydrated. It's also important to get regular trims to prevent split ends and breakage.</p><p>In conclusion, perms are definitely back in style in 2020 and beyond! If you're thinking of getting a perm, make sure to find a hairstylist who specializes in perms, communicate with them about the type of perm you want, and take care of your curls after the perm is done.</p></article>

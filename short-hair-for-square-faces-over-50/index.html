Square faces have a wide forehead, strong jawline, and sharp features that can make it challenging to find the right hairstyle. But don't worry, we've got you covered! In this article, we'll discuss some tips and tricks to help you find the perfect short hair for square faces over 50.</p><h2>Description: What is a Square Face?</h2><p>A square face is a face shape characterized by a broad forehead, wide cheekbones, and a strong jawline. If you have a square face, your face width and length are almost equal, and your jawline is sharp and angular. Your face shape is often described as masculine or bold, and you might have a prominent chin.</p><h2>How to: Choose the Right Short Haircut for Square Faces over 50?</h2><p>Short haircuts are an excellent choice for square faces over 50 because they help to soften the sharp features of your face shape. Here are some tips to help you choose the right haircut:</p><h3>1. Consider Face Framing Layers</h3><p>Face framing layers can help to soften the angles of your face and add texture and movement to your hair. This type of haircut can be particularly flattering for square faces over 50 because it draws attention away from the jawline and towards the eyes and cheekbones.</p><h3>2. Go for a Pixie Cut</h3><p>A pixie cut is a short, cropped hairstyle that can look great on square faces over 50. This type of haircut can help to balance out your face shape by creating volume on top of your head and minimizing the width of your jawline. It also adds a youthful touch to your look.</p><h3>3. Try a Bob</h3><p>A bob is another excellent option for square faces over 50. A chin-length bob can help to soften the angles of your face while still maintaining a classic and sophisticated look. You can also add layers or bangs to your bob to create more texture and movement.</p><h2>Step by Step: How to Style Short Hair for Square Faces over 50?</h2><p>Once you've chosen the right short haircut for your square face over 50, it's time to learn how to style it. Here are some step-by-step instructions:</p><h3>1. Start with Clean Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with a mild shampoo and conditioner to remove any dirt and oil. Pat your hair dry with a towel and comb it through to remove any tangles.</p><h3>2. Apply a Styling Product</h3><p>Apply a small amount of styling product to your hair to help it hold its shape. Use a mousse or a gel to add volume and texture to your hair.</p><h3>3. Blow Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Use a hairdryer to blow dry your hair in the direction you want it to go. Use a round brush to add volume to the roots and create a smooth finish.</p><h3>4. Style Your Hair</h3><p>Use a straightening iron or a curling wand to style your hair. You can create loose curls or waves to add texture and movement to your hair. Finish with a hairspray to hold your style in place.</p><h2>Tips: How to Maintain Your Short Haircut for Square Faces over 50?</h2><p>To keep your short haircut looking great, follow these tips:</p><h3>1. Trim Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>Visit your hairstylist every 4-6 weeks to trim your hair and maintain your haircut's shape.</p><h3>2. Use the Right Products</h3><p>Use hair products that are designed for your hair type and style. Avoid using heavy products that can weigh down your hair.</p><h3>3. Protect Your Hair from Heat</h3><p>Use a heat protectant spray before using any hot styling tools to prevent damage to your hair.</p><h2>FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions about Short Hair for Square Faces over 50</h2><h3>1. Can I wear bangs with a short haircut for a square face?</h3><p>Yes, you can wear bangs with a short haircut for a square face. Side-swept bangs or layered bangs can help to soften the angles of your face and draw attention to your eyes.</p><h3>2. Will a short haircut make me look older?</h3><p>No, a short haircut will not necessarily make you look older. In fact, a well-styled short haircut can make you look younger and more vibrant.</p><h3>3. How can I add volume to my short haircut?</h3><p>You can add volume to your short haircut by using a volumizing shampoo and conditioner, blow-drying your hair with a round brush, and using a texturizing product to create volume and texture.</p><h2>Hair Care: Final Thoughts on Short Hair for Square Faces over 50</h2><p>Short haircuts can be an excellent choice for square faces over 50. They help to soften the sharp angles of your face and add texture and movement to your hair. Whether you choose a pixie cut, a bob, or face-framing layers, make sure to choose a haircut that suits your style and personality.

Here are some tips on how to grow out a pixie cut curly hair:</p><h3>1. Be Patient</h3><p>Growing out a pixie cut takes time, especially if you have curly hair.

Headbands, hair clips, and hair ties can help keep your hair out of your face and make the growing out process a little more bearable.</p><h3>4. Experiment with Styles</h3><p>Just because your hair is growing out doesn't mean you can't have fun with it. Experiment with different styles, like braids, twists, and updos, to keep your hair looking fresh and stylish while it grows out.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><h3>Step 1: Decide on Your Desired Length</h3><p>Before you start growing out your pixie cut, decide on your desired length.

Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner. Make sure to use products that are designed for your hair type. Rinse your hair thoroughly and towel-dry it.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Heat Protectant</h3><p>Before you start straightening your hair, apply a heat protectant product to protect it from heat damage. This will also help to keep your hair looking smooth and shiny.</p><h3>Step 3: Blow-Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Using a hair dryer, blow-dry your hair until it is completely dry. Use a round brush to help smooth out your hair as you blow-dry it. If you have very curly hair, you may need to use a diffuser attachment to help dry your hair without frizzing it.</p><h3>Step 4: Divide Your Hair into Sections</h3><p>Divide your hair into small sections using hair clips. This will make it easier to straighten your hair and ensure that you don’t miss any sections.</p><h3>Step 5: Straighten Your Hair</h3><p>Starting at the roots, use a flat iron to straighten each section of hair. Use a comb to help guide the flat iron through your hair, and make sure to move the flat iron slowly and evenly through each section. Repeat this process for each section of hair.</p><h3>Step 6: Finish with Hair Serum</h3><p>Once your hair is completely straight, apply a small amount of hair serum to the ends of your hair. This will help to keep your hair looking smooth and shiny.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here’s a more detailed guide to straightening small curly hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner.

For example, "Vorrei un taglio di capelli corto" (I would like a short haircut).</li><li>If you have a picture of the style you want, show it to your barber.</li><li>If you need a shave or beard trim, use the terms "rasatura" or "barba".</li><li>If you're not sure what style you want, ask for a recommendation.

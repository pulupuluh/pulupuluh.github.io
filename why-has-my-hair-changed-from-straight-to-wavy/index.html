Hormonal changes can also contribute to changes in hair texture. For example, during puberty, pregnancy or menopause, hormonal changes can cause your hair to become wavier or curlier.</p><p>Another reason why your hair may have changed from straight to wavy is damage. Excessive heat styling, chemical treatments, and harsh hair products can all damage your hair and alter its texture.

Do not rub your hair as this can cause frizz.</li><li>Apply a leave-in conditioner or styling product to your hair, focusing on the mid-lengths and ends.</li><li>Scrunch your hair upwards towards your scalp to encourage your waves.</li><li>Diffuse your hair using a hair dryer on a low heat setting. Use a diffuser attachment to enhance your waves.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for caring for your wavy hair:</p><ul><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it's dry as this can cause frizz. Instead, use a wide-toothed comb or your fingers to detangle your hair when it's wet.</li><li>Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase to reduce friction and prevent frizz.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools on your hair too often as this can cause damage and alter your hair texture.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair healthy and moisturized.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Can my hair change from wavy to straight?</h3><p>Yes, it's possible for your hair to change from wavy to straight.

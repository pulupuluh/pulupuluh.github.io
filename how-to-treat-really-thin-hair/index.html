Look for a product that contains keratin, which can help to strengthen your hair.</p><h3>Step 5: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Style your hair using a wide-toothed comb, and avoid using heat styling tools if possible. If you do need to use a flat iron or curling iron, use it on a low heat setting.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Managing Really Thin Hair</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for managing really thin hair:</p><h3>1.

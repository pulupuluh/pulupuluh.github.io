However, some people shy away from it because they believe it can make them look paler. This is a common misconception, but there are some factors that can contribute to this belief.

However, this is not always the case.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Determine If Black Hair Makes You Look Paler</h2><p>The easiest way to determine if black hair makes you look paler is to try it out for yourself. You can experiment with different shades of black hair color to see which one complements your skin tone best. Another way to determine this is to use the vein test. Look at the veins on the inside of your wrist. If they appear blue, you have cool undertones, and if they appear green, you have warm undertones. If you have cool undertones, opt for a blue-black or cool-toned black hair color.

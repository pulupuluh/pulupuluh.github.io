Some people may have more pubic hair than others, and some may experience changes in their pubic hair growth as they age. Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during puberty and menopause, can have an effect on pubic hair growth.

Be sure to wash the area with gentle soap and warm water, and avoid harsh chemicals or scrubbing too hard.</p><h3>2.

Consider hair removal options</h3><p>If you prefer a hair-free pubic area, there are several hair removal options to choose from. These include shaving, waxing, and laser hair removal. Be sure to choose a method that works best for your skin type and hair texture.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by step</h2><p>If you are experiencing changes in your pubic hair growth, there are a few steps you can take to help maintain healthy hair:</p><h3>1.

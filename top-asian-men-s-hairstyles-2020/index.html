In this article, we will be sharing with you some of the most trendy and stylish hairstyles that dominated the Asian men's hair scene last year. Whether you have straight or curly hair, we've got you covered. So, let's dive right in!</p><h2>How to Choose the Right Hairstyle?</h2><p>Choosing the right hairstyle can be a daunting task, especially with so many options available. Here are some tips to help you select the perfect hairstyle:</p><h3>Consider Your Face Shape</h3><p>Your face shape plays a crucial role in determining which hairstyle would suit you the best. For instance, if you have a round face, a hairstyle with some height on top will help elongate your face. On the other hand, if you have a square face, a hairstyle with soft edges will complement your features.</p><h3>Think About Your Hair Type</h3><p>The texture and thickness of your hair are also important factors to consider when selecting a hairstyle. If you have thick hair, you can opt for a voluminous hairstyle with layers. However, if you have thin hair, a short and sleek hairstyle will work better for you.</p><h3>Consider Your Lifestyle</h3><p>Your lifestyle and profession should also be taken into account when choosing a hairstyle. If you have a corporate job, a neat and professional hairstyle would be more appropriate. However, if you're a creative professional, you can experiment with more edgy and unconventional hairstyles.</p><h2>Top Asian Men's Hairstyles of 2020</h2><p>Now that you know how to choose the right hairstyle, let's take a look at some of the top Asian men's hairstyles of 2020:</p><h3>1. The Textured Crop</h3><p>The textured crop is a low-maintenance and versatile hairstyle that works well for most face shapes and hair types. It involves cutting the hair short on the sides and back, while leaving some length on top. The hair on top is then styled into a messy, textured look.</p><h3>2. The Undercut</h3><p>The undercut has been a popular hairstyle for men for several years now, and it's not going away anytime soon. This hairstyle involves shaving the sides and back of the head, while leaving the hair on top longer. The hair on top can be styled into a slick back, a pompadour, or any other style you prefer.</p><h3>3. The Side Part</h3><p>The side part is a classic hairstyle that never goes out of style. It involves parting the hair on one side and combing it over to the other side. This hairstyle works well for most face shapes and can be styled with a fade or undercut on the sides.</p><h3>4. The Slick Back</h3><p>The slick back is a timeless hairstyle that exudes confidence and sophistication. It involves combing the hair back and away from the face, using a pomade or gel to keep it in place. This hairstyle works well for most hair types and face shapes.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Q. How often should I get a haircut?</h3><p>A. It's recommended to get a haircut every four to six weeks to maintain your hairstyle and keep it looking fresh.</p><h3>Q. What products should I use to style my hair?</h3><p>A. The products you use will depend on your hair type and the hairstyle you're trying to achieve. However, some popular styling products for men include pomade, hair wax, and hair gel.</p><h2>Hair Care Tips</h2><p>Here are some hair care tips to keep your hair healthy and looking its best:</p><h3>1. Use a Gentle Shampoo</h3><p>Use a gentle shampoo that's suitable for your hair type to avoid stripping your hair of its natural oils.</p><h3>2. Condition Regularly</h3><p>Condition your hair regularly to keep it hydrated and nourished.</p><h3>3. Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Avoid using heat styling tools like hair dryers and straighteners too often, as they can damage your hair.</p><h3>4. Get Regular Trims</h3><p>Get regular trims to prevent split ends and maintain your hairstyle.</p><p>So, there you have it – our comprehensive guide on the top Asian men's hairstyles of 2020. We hope this article has given you some inspiration for your next haircut. Don't forget to take your face shape, hair type, and lifestyle into consideration when choosing a hairstyle, and always take good care of your hair to keep it looking healthy and stylish.</p></article>

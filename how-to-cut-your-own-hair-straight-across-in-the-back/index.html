Start with clean, dry hair</h3><p>Wash and dry your hair thoroughly before you begin. Make sure it's completely dry, as wet hair can be difficult to cut evenly.</p><h3>2. Divide your hair into sections</h3><p>Use a comb to divide your hair into sections. Start by creating a middle part, then bring the hair forward over your shoulders. Divide the hair into two sections, one on each side of your head.</p><h3>3. Cut the bottom layer</h3><p>Take one of the sections and gather it all together at the nape of your neck. Use a hair tie or clip to secure the rest of your hair out of the way. This will be your bottom layer. Take your scissors and cut straight across, using the bottom of your hair as a guide. Make sure your scissors are sharp and cut slowly to avoid any mistakes.</p><h3>4. Cut the top layer</h3><p>Release the top layer of hair and bring it down over the bottom layer. Use the bottom layer as a guide and cut straight across. Be sure to cut the top layer evenly with the bottom layer.</p><h3>5. Check for evenness</h3><p>Use a mirror to check the back of your hair for evenness. If you notice any uneven spots, trim them carefully with your scissors.</p><h2 id="tips">Helpful Tips</h2><p>Cutting your own hair can be intimidating, but with a few helpful tips, you'll be able to achieve a professional-looking cut:</p><ul><li>Invest in a good pair of hair cutting scissors.

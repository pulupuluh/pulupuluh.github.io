These hairstyles are perfect for medium length hair and will make you look stunning on your prom night.</p><h2>How To</h2><p>Before we start with the hairstyles, it is important to prepare your hair properly. Wash your hair the day before prom and use a moisturizing conditioner. Blow dry your hair and use a heat protectant spray to protect your hair from heat damage. Now, let's move on to the hairstyles.</p><h3>The Half-Up Half-Down Hairstyle</h3><p>The half-up half-down hairstyle is a classic prom hairstyle that works well for medium length hair.

You can either leave the bottom half of your hair straight or curl it with a curling iron. This hairstyle is simple yet elegant and will make you look stunning on prom night.</p><h3>The Low Bun Hairstyle</h3><p>The low bun hairstyle is perfect for a more sophisticated look. Start by pulling your hair back into a low ponytail and securing it with a hair tie. Twist your hair around the hair tie to create a bun and secure it with bobby pins. You can leave some hair out at the front to frame your face.

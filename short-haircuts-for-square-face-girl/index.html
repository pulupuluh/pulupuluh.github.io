The pixie cut is a short, choppy haircut that can add volume to the top of your head and soften your features.

The layered bob is a variation of the bob that adds texture and movement to the hair, making it a great choice for square face girls.</p><h3>Step by Step Instructions for Getting a Short Haircut for Square Face Girls</h3><p>Once you’ve chosen a short haircut that suits your face shape, it’s time to head to the salon.

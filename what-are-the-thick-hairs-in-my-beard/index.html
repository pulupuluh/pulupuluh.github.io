These hairs are different from vellus hairs, which are softer and shorter hairs that cover most of your face.</p><p>Terminal hairs are usually the last hairs to grow in your beard, and they can take several months to fully develop. They are also the most visible hairs in your beard, which is why they play a crucial role in your beard's overall appearance.</p><h2>Why Do Terminal Hairs Matter?</h2><p>Terminal hairs are important for a few reasons. Firstly, they provide structure and shape to your beard. Without terminal hairs, your beard would look patchy and uneven.</p><p>Secondly, terminal hairs are the most visible hairs in your beard. They are the hairs that people will notice first, so it's important to keep them healthy and well-groomed.</p><h2>How to Take Care of Terminal Hairs</h2><p>If you want to keep your terminal hairs looking their best, there are a few things you can do:</p><h3>1.

Use a pair of scissors or a beard trimmer to trim your beard every few weeks. This will help to keep your beard looking neat and tidy.</p><h3>4. Eat a Healthy Diet</h3><p>Your diet can have a big impact on the health of your beard. Eating a diet rich in vitamins and minerals can help to promote healthy hair growth. Make sure to eat plenty of protein, fruits, and vegetables to keep your beard looking its best.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q. Can I Make My Terminal Hairs Thicker?</h3><p>A.

Start applying the gel to your hair, starting at the roots and working your way down to the tips. Make sure to distribute the gel evenly throughout your hair.</p><p>5. Once you have applied the gel, use a wide-tooth comb to comb your hair back, away from your face. This will help create the slicked-back look commonly associated with the wet hair look.</p><p>6.

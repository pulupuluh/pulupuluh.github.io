Do you want to switch things up without going to a salon? Cutting your own fringe (also known as bangs) is a great way to give yourself a fresh, new look. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to cut your own fringe at home. </p><h2>How to Cut Your Own Fringe 2020</h2><p>Before we get started, it is important to gather the necessary tools. You will need:</p><ul><li>Sharp hair cutting scissors</li><li>A comb</li><li>Clips to section off your hair</li><li>A ruler or tape measure</li></ul><h3>Step 1: Choose Your Fringe Style</h3><p>Before you start cutting, it is important to decide what kind of fringe you want. Consult online guides or magazines to choose a style that complements your face shape and hair texture. </p><h3>Step 2: Prepare Your Hair</h3><p>Wash and dry your hair thoroughly before starting. Use a comb to part your hair down the middle and section off the hair that you want to cut into a fringe. </p><h3>Step 3: Measure Your Fringe</h3><p>Use a ruler or tape measure to determine the length of your fringe. Measure from the point where you want your fringe to start (usually the top of your head) to the desired length. </p><h3>Step 4: Start Cutting</h3><p>Using your scissors, start cutting your fringe. It is important to work slowly and carefully. Cut small sections at a time and check your progress frequently. </p><h3>Step 5: Check for Symmetry</h3><p>Once you have cut your fringe, use a mirror to check for symmetry. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure that your fringe is even on both sides. </p><h3>Step 6: Style Your Fringe</h3><p>Now that your fringe is cut, it is time to style it. Use a round brush and a blow dryer to create volume and shape. You can also use a straightener or curling iron to add texture. </p><h2>Tips for Cutting Your Own Fringe</h2><ul><li>Start with a longer length and cut gradually. You can always go shorter, but you can't go back once you've cut too much. </li><li>Use sharp scissors to avoid split ends and a jagged cut.</li><li>Don't cut your fringe when it is wet, as it will shrink when it dries.</li><li>Use clips to section off your hair and make it easier to cut.</li><li>Take breaks and step away from the mirror to avoid over-cutting.</li></ul><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Can I cut my fringe with regular scissors?</h3><p>No, it is important to use hair cutting scissors as they are sharper and designed to cut hair evenly. </p><h3>How often should I trim my fringe?</h3><p>It is recommended to trim your fringe every 4-6 weeks to maintain its shape and length. </p><h2>Hair Care for Your Fringe</h2><p>Once you have cut your fringe, it is important to take care of it to maintain its shape and health. Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid drying out your hair. Avoid using heat tools too frequently and use a heat protectant spray when you do. </p><p>Cutting your own fringe can be a fun and rewarding way to switch up your look. By following these steps and tips, you can achieve a stylish and professional-looking fringe from the comfort of your own home. </p></article>

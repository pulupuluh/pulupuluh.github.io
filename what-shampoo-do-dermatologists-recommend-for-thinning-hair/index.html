It helps to strengthen the hair and prevent breakage, which can lead to thinning hair. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is another essential nutrient that promotes hair growth by improving blood circulation to the scalp. Caffeine is a natural stimulant that can increase blood flow to the scalp and promote hair growth.

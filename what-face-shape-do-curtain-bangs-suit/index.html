They are called "curtain" bangs because they resemble the drapes that hang on either side of a window. Curtain bangs are a popular hairstyle that first became popular in the 1960s and 70s, and have recently made a comeback.</p><h2 id="what-face-shape-do-curtain-bangs-suit">What Face Shape Do Curtain Bangs Suit?</h2><p>Curtain bangs can suit various face shapes, but they are particularly flattering on oval and heart-shaped faces. Oval faces have balanced proportions, which means that they can pull off most hairstyles, including curtain bangs. Heart-shaped faces have a wider forehead and a narrower chin, which makes curtain bangs a great option to balance out the face shape.</p><p>If you have a round face, curtain bangs can also work for you, provided they are cut in a way that complements your face shape. For example, instead of having straight-across bangs, you can have longer, side-swept bangs that elongate your face.</p><p>If you have a square face, curtain bangs can soften your features and add some femininity to your look. The key is to have bangs that are longer on the sides and shorter in the middle, which will create an illusion of a narrower forehead.</p><p>For those with a diamond-shaped face, curtain bangs can also work, especially if you have a wider forehead and a more pointed chin. Again, the key is to have bangs that are longer on the sides and shorter in the middle, which will balance out your face shape.</p><h2 id="how-to-style-curtain-bangs">How to Style Curtain Bangs</h2><p>Curtain bangs are versatile and can be styled in different ways, depending on your preference.

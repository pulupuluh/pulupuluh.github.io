Here are the basic steps for backcombing hair 80s style:</p><h3>1. Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and drying your hair. Apply some volumizing mousse or spray to your roots for extra lift. Brush your hair to remove any tangles and make sure it's completely detangled.</p><h3>2. Section Your Hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into sections, starting at the crown of your head. Clip the top section away for now and work on the lower sections first.</p><h3>3. Tease Your Hair</h3><p>Take a small section of hair and hold it straight up. Using a fine-toothed comb, backcomb the hair towards your scalp in short, quick strokes. Repeat this process with each section, working your way up to the crown of your head. </p><p>For a more dramatic look, tease your hair in sections that are smaller than the desired result to create more volume.</p><h3>4. Smooth Your Hair</h3><p>After teasing each section, gently smooth the top layer of hair over the teased section to create a sleek, polished finish.</p><h3>5. Finish Your Look</h3><p>Spray some hairspray over your hair to hold the style in place. Use your fingers to shape the hair and create your desired look. Add some accessories like a headband, scrunchie, or hair clips to complete your 80s style.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a more detailed step-by-step guide for achieving the perfect backcombed hair 80s style:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair.

Don't Overdo It</h3><p>Backcombing can be damaging to your hair, so don't overdo it. Tease your hair only as much as you need to achieve the desired volume and texture.</p><h3>4.

Use a smaller comb or a teasing brush to tease your hair in small sections for a more subtle effect.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care for Backcombed Hair</h2><p>Backcombing can be damaging to your hair if done too frequently or aggressively. Here are some tips to care for your backcombed hair:</p><h3>1. Wash Your Hair Less</h3><p>Washing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils and cause damage. Try washing your hair every other day or every three days to prevent damage.</p><h3>2. Use a Deep Conditioning Treatment</h3><p>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to help repair and nourish your hair. Look for a treatment that's specifically designed for damaged or color-treated hair.</p><h3>3. Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons can cause damage to your hair. Try air-drying your hair or using a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to minimize heat damage.</p><p>By following these tips and techniques, you can backcomb your hair 80s style while keeping it healthy and strong.

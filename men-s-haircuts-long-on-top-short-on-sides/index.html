This versatile style can be adapted to suit different hair types and face shapes, and it's easy to style for a casual or formal look. In this article, we'll show you how to get the long on top short on sides haircut, how to style it, and how to take care of it.</p><h2>Description of Men's Haircuts Long on Top Short on Sides</h2><p>Men's haircuts long on top short on sides are characterized by a longer length on the top of the head and shorter sides and back. The length on the top can vary from a few inches to shoulder-length, depending on your preference and hair type. The sides and back are usually tapered or faded, creating a gradual transition from long to short hair. This haircut can be styled in many ways, such as slicked back, messy, curly, or straight.</p><h2>How to Get a Men's Haircut Long on Top Short on Sides</h2><p>If you're going to a barber or stylist, you can ask for a men's haircut long on top short on sides by showing them a picture of the style you want. Be specific about the length you want on the top and the type of fade or taper you prefer on the sides and back. If you're cutting your own hair, you'll need clippers, scissors, and a comb. Start by trimming the sides and back with a #2 or #3 clipper guard, then blend the hair into the longer hair on top with scissors. Use the comb to lift the hair and cut it to the desired length.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Styling a Men's Haircut Long on Top Short on Sides</h2><p>Styling a men's haircut long on top short on sides is easy and simple. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Towel-Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Begin by washing your hair with a shampoo and conditioner that suits your hair type. Towel-dry your hair to remove excess water, but don't rub your hair vigorously, as this can cause damage and frizz.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply a Styling Product</h3><p>Apply a styling product to your hair, such as a pomade, wax, or gel. Use a small amount, starting from the back of your head and working your way forward. Distribute the product evenly with your fingers or a comb.</p><h3>Step 3: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Style your hair according to your preference. You can slick it back, create a side part, comb it over, or leave it messy. Use a blow dryer if you want more volume or a sleeker look. Finish with a hairspray if you want extra hold.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining a Men's Haircut Long on Top Short on Sides</h2><p>Here are some tips for maintaining a men's haircut long on top short on sides:</p><ul><li>Trim the sides and back every 2-3 weeks to maintain the shape and length.</li><li>Use a high-quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and shiny.</li><li>Avoid using too much styling product, as this can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.</li><li>Protect your hair from heat damage by using a heat protectant spray before blow-drying or styling with hot tools.</li><li>Consider getting regular haircuts from a professional stylist to keep your hair in top condition.</li></ul><h2>FAQ About Men's Haircuts Long on Top Short on Sides</h2><h3>What face shape is best for a men's haircut long on top short on sides?</h3><p>A men's haircut long on top short on sides can suit different face shapes, but it's particularly flattering for men with oval or square faces.

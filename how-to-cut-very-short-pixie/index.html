It's a bold and edgy hairstyle that is perfect for those who want to make a statement with their hair. Here are the steps to cutting a very short pixie cut:</p><h3>Step 1: Gather Your Tools</h3><p>Before you begin, you'll need to gather your tools. You will need a pair of clippers, scissors, a comb, and a spray bottle filled with water.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into four sections, using clips to hold them in place. Start at the nape of your neck and move upwards, clipping each section as you go.</p><h3>Step 3: Start with the Clippers</h3><p>Begin with the clippers and a guard that's the same length you want your hair to be. Starting at the nape of your neck, use the clippers to cut your hair in an upward motion. Repeat this process for each section of hair, making sure to blend the hair as you go.</p><h3>Step 4: Use Scissors to Add Texture</h3><p>Once you've finished with the clippers, use scissors to add texture to your hair. This will help to create a more natural and edgy look. Take small sections of hair and use the scissors to cut at an angle, creating a choppy texture.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with Styling</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting your hair, you'll want to style it. Use a hair product, such as a wax or pomade, to add texture and hold to your hair. Style your hair as desired, using your fingers to create a messy and textured look.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a more detailed step-by-step guide on how to cut a very short pixie haircut:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and drying your hair. This will help to remove any product buildup and make it easier to cut. Once your hair is dry, brush it out to remove any tangles or knots.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into four parts, using clips to hold them in place. Section your hair from the nape of your neck to the crown of your head.</p><h3>Step 3: Start with the Clippers</h3><p>Begin with the clippers and a guard that's the same length you want your hair to be. Starting at the nape of your neck, use the clippers to cut your hair in an upward motion. Make sure to blend the hair as you go, so that there are no harsh lines.</p><h3>Step 4: Move Upward and Repeat</h3><p>Move upward, repeating the same process with the clippers. Make sure to blend the hair as you go, so that there are no harsh lines. Repeat this process for each section of hair.</p><h3>Step 5: Use Scissors to Add Texture</h3><p>Once you've finished with the clippers, use scissors to add texture to your hair. Take small sections of hair and use the scissors to cut at an angle, creating a choppy texture. This will help to create a more natural and edgy look.</p><h3>Step 6: Check for Balance</h3><p>Check for balance by looking at your hair in the mirror. Make sure that both sides are even and that there are no harsh lines. If you need to make any adjustments, do so with the scissors.</p><h3>Step 7: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting your hair, you'll want to style it. Use a hair product, such as a wax or pomade, to add texture and hold to your hair. Style your hair as desired, using your fingers to create a messy and textured look.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips and Tricks</h2><p>Here are some tips and tricks to help you cut a very short pixie haircut:</p><ul><li>Start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter guard, so that you don't cut your hair too short.</li><li>Use a spray bottle filled with water to wet your hair, so that it's easier to cut.</li><li>Take your time and don't rush the process.
